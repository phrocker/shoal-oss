// Package embedbackfill resolves tablet files whose embedding-space
// state was never recorded.
//
// # Why this exists
//
// Issue #274 stopped the metadata layers fabricating no_embeddings for a
// file that carries no file.embedding column. Absence of the column now
// reads as unknown, which is the honest answer and the fail-closed one.
// It is also, for an existing cluster, a large number of files that used
// to carry a (false) definite label and now carry none.
//
// The backfill is the migration path. It walks the files, establishes
// each one's real state, and writes the explicit column so unknown
// resolves to something definite.
//
// # What counts as truth
//
// The RFile (or Parquet) footer meta block written by whoever produced
// the file — embeddingspace.RFileMetaBlockName. It travels with the
// file, it was written by the producer, and it cannot be desynchronised
// from the bytes it describes. Nothing else is consulted, and in
// particular the backfill never inspects cell values to guess whether
// something looks like a vector: a guess written into durable metadata
// is exactly the failure this whole change set exists to remove.
//
// A file whose footer does not establish a known state — the meta block
// is absent, or present and explicitly unknown — therefore cannot be
// resolved from metadata alone. Those files are left unknown and
// reported individually, with the reason, so an operator knows precisely
// which files need attention and why. Marking them no_embeddings to make
// the report look clean would reintroduce the bug.
//
// # Safety
//
// Every write is conditional on the file entry still being present and
// unchanged, and on the embedding column still holding exactly what it
// held when the file was examined — absent, or an explicit unknown. A
// file that was compacted away mid-run is reported as raced, not
// written. A file that already carries a definite column is left alone.
// Re-running the backfill over an already-backfilled table therefore
// writes nothing and reports every file as already labelled, which is
// what makes it safe to run repeatedly and safe to interrupt.
