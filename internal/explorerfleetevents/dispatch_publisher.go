		// commit whose whole subject was that class of mismatch.
		//
		// Derived from AuthorizedOperations rather than read from
		// TransitionOperation. Reading the field is the fix the obvious
		// reading produces, and a review found it wrong in both directions.
		// cloneActionRecord carries the field forward, so a record cancelled
		// by a build before Cancel set it holds the *claim's* operation:
		// reading it published such a record under invoke, which the canceller
		// — who needs only dispatch — cannot authorize, turning a committed
		// cancel into a 503. And a denial written by a pre-fix build has an
		// empty field, so any constant fallback outside its [invoke] set left
		// it permanently unpublishable with an undrainable outbox row.
		//
		// AuthorizedOperations has neither problem. Cancel widens it with
		// dispatch, precisely so the cancel's own authority is on the record;
		// an admission denial carries [invoke] and nothing widens it. So
		// preferring dispatch when present and falling to invoke when not
		// names the operation that actually authorized the transition, for
		// records written before and after this change, and repairs the
