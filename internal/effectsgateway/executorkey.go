// decode to one key, so two keys are compared as bytes (Equal) and never as
// strings: comparing spellings would call one key two different keys.

// '\r' and '\n' inside its input, so without the explicit check a key with an
// embedded newline would decode to the same bytes as the clean one and pass —
// which is harmless for this value and still not something a strict decoder
