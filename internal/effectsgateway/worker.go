// The worker loop (#391):
//
//	PULL → FILTER → PRECHECK → [ATTEST] → CLAIM → BIND → SEND → CLASSIFY → COMPLETE
//
// with FENCE_LOST reachable from every state after CLAIM.
//
//   - FILTER: the record's agent, capability and action must be this
//     gateway's and have a route. The pull page has no server-side filter,
//     and a claim is what sets EffectPossible, so nothing else is claimed.
//   - PRECHECK uses only the pull page: for a key route, the action's
//     deadline − created_at must lie within the target's idempotency
//     retention; and the explorer's estimated now + T + ReportWindow must be
//     before the deadline. A refused record is skipped, never claimed.
//   - ATTEST: when the action requires attestation and the attestation in
//     hand expires before the explorer's now + L + ReportWindow, present
//     again before claiming.
//   - CLAIM: a fresh claim ID per attempt. A repull, 404 or 409 is a signal
//     to pull again, never "gone".
//   - BIND, SEND: the binder's pure request, through the egress-restricted
//     client, gated before every attempt by the send gate.
//   - COMPLETE: bound on the claim fence, with the effected volume on a
//     failure that may have left (#427).
//
// The lease is extended every L/2 from the anchor of the last claim or
// extension, re-attesting first if needed, and the local lease end is always
// the explorer's (clamped) end anchored on the local clock, never the lease
// requested. A refused extension, or the local lease end arriving, is
// FENCE_LOST: with nothing sent the worker reports request_not_sent and lets
// the claim lapse; with a request in flight it lets the request finish and
// reports effect_observed or outcome_unknown. At most one report is made per
// fence, and a report the explorer does not record goes to the unrecorded log.
