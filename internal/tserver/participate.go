// Participate holds one tablet-server ServiceLock generation on behalf of a
// Host, and keeps the two in step for exactly as long as the lock lasts.
//
// It acquires the lock, hands the generation to the host, watches it, and when
// the generation ends — lost, or given up because ctx ended — drops every
// tablet the host was claiming under it and passes them to release so the
// caller can close them.
//
// The order on the way out is deliberate: the host stops claiming tablets
// before the lock node is deleted. Deleting the node first would tell the
// manager it may place those tablets elsewhere while this process still
// claimed them.
//
// It covers one generation and returns when that generation is over. A process
// that means to rejoin builds a new ServiceLock and calls Participate again.
// Host.AdoptLock takes the new generation only when its sequence is above
// every generation that host has already used, which is what makes a rejoin
// distinguishable from a replay of the generation that just ended.
//
// That ordering is ZooKeeper's for as long as the lock directory survives, but
// it does not hold across one being deleted and recreated: the sequential
// counter lives on the parent, so a recreated directory hands out numbers from
// zero again. It is the same case ServiceLock.Verify reports as
// LossSuperseded, seen from the other side — a rejoin into a recreated
// directory can be handed a sequence the host has already used, and AdoptLock
// refuses it with ErrLockNotNewer. Recovering means building a fresh Host: the
// high-water mark it compares against is per-host state, so only a host that
// has used nothing can accept a generation numbered below the one it lost. A
// caller that rebuilds the lock without rebuilding the host has to read
// ErrLockNotNewer as that instruction rather than as a transient failure to
// retry, because retrying against the same host will refuse it every time.
//
// Returns an error wrapping ErrLockLost when the lock ended on its own, or
// ctx.Err() when the caller ended it. Both mean the same thing to the host:
// nothing is hosted here any more.
