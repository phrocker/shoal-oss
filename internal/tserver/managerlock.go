// A node counts here only when its UUID is the canonical 36-character form,
// which is what Java's UUID.fromString takes and therefore what Accumulo ever
// writes. internal/zk, which resolves the manager's Thrift address from this
// same directory, is looser: it counts any spelling uuid.Parse accepts, the
// undashed and URN forms among them. On a directory Accumulo wrote the two
// always agree. On one holding a node in a spelling only internal/zk counts,
// numbered below the real holder, they would not — this side would observe the
// manager Accumulo calls the holder while internal/zk resolved an address that
// is not one. Following Accumulo is the right side of that divergence, but the
// two readers should share one parser, and that is a change to internal/zk
// rather than a second opinion here.

// WatchManagerLock keeps a Host's view of live manager authority in step with
// ZooKeeper until ctx ends, polling every interval.
//
// This is what makes manager-directed transitions possible at all: Host
// refuses every one of them until it has been told which manager is live, and
// it decides authority from this observation rather than from the requests it
// receives. A manager cannot talk its way into authority it does not hold.
//
// A read that fails leaves the previous observation in place. Failing to read
// ZooKeeper is not evidence that the manager changed, and withdrawing
// authority on a transient failure would refuse the live manager's assignments
// for no reason. A directory that is readable and holds no lock is evidence,
// and clears the observation.
//
// An observation the host refuses — a live holder whose epoch is older than
// one already seen — is handed to refused, which may be nil, and the watch
// goes on polling. The error wraps ErrLockNotNewer.
//
// It is reported rather than acted on because nothing here can tell what
// caused it. Readings go backwards for two very different reasons: the lock
// directory was deleted and recreated, which restarts the sequence counter and
// does not heal, or the reading came from a ZooKeeper server that has not
// caught up. Readings are not monotonic across calls — a reader that opens a
// session per read can land on a lagging replica repeatedly — so no number of
// refusals separates the two. A count makes the mistake less frequent, never
// impossible, and a count that acts on the mistake is worse than one that does
// not.
//
// Safety does not depend on separating them. The host keeps the newer epoch
// whatever a reading says, so a stale one never gains authority; that holds on
// the first refusal and on the thousandth. Ending the watch would add only a
// guess with a cost: a lagging ensemble is read by every tablet server at
// once, so ending on it restarts all of them, discarding the high-water marks
// that were doing the rejecting. A recreated directory does need the fresh
// Host that AdoptLock's refusal already calls for, but that call belongs to
// the supervisor, which can establish the cause. This package reports what it
// saw.
//
// The report is made once per run of refusals rather than once per poll, since
// a condition that persists is one condition. A single refusal is not reported
// at all: one stale reading is ordinary, and the host has already refused it.
//
// Only a reading the host accepts ends a run. A poll that could not be read
// leaves it where it was, because it is not evidence of anything: treating it
// as a clean reading would let refusals interleaved with unreadable polls go
// unreported.
