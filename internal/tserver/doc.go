// Package tserver holds the Accumulo tablet-server participation logic: the
// state a Shoal process must keep so an unmodified Accumulo manager can
// assign, monitor, migrate, and unassign the tablets it hosts.
//
// The manager is the only assignment authority. Nothing here decides what to
// host: Host is a reactive state machine that applies manager-directed
// transitions, rejects the ones that cannot be safely applied, and reports
// what it currently hosts. It never assigns, migrates, or unassigns a tablet
// on its own, and it never overrides a live manager's decision. The live
// manager lock that defines that authority is observed externally rather than
// inferred from request history.
//
// What it does own is the fence. Every transition carries the ServiceLock
// generation it was minted under, and anything that cannot be proven current
// fails closed — a stale assignment is refused rather than applied, because a
// wrongly accepted assignment means a multiply hosted tablet. See
// docs/tserver-hosting-lifecycle.md for the state machine and fencing rules.
