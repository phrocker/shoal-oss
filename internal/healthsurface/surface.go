// Package healthsurface is the orchestrator probe listener shared by every
// Shoal process that serves a request surface a kubelet cannot address.
//
// It is a package rather than a copy in each command because the two
// properties that make it correct are orderings, not values — readiness drops
// before the server stops accepting, and shutdown joins the serve loop before
// reading its error. A second implementation would have to keep both
// agreements, and a matched pair of implementations is a promise someone
// eventually breaks. The dispatch and admission claim paths drifted twice
// exactly that way.

// The health surface is deliberately a second listener rather than two more
// routes on the workspace handler.
//
// The workspace handler refuses any request whose Host is not an exactly
// matching configured authority (webapi.Handler.ServeHTTP consults
// hostAuthority.permits before routing, authentication, or anything else). A
// kubelet probe addresses the pod by its runtime-assigned IP, which no
// statically configured authority list can name, so every probe against the
// workspace port answers 421 and the pod never becomes ready. Widening the
// authority list to admit the pod IP would weaken the control that exists to
// stop misdirected and DNS-rebound requests, to fix an operational problem.
//
// A separate listener keeps that control untouched. It also separates the two
// audiences: the workspace port serves callers who hold a decision, and the
// health port serves an orchestrator that holds nothing and must learn
// nothing. This mirrors the read fleet, which already answers /healthz and
// /readyz on its metrics listener rather than on its Thrift port.
//
// The surface discloses nothing. Both routes answer with a status code and a
// fixed string; neither consults the corpus, the policy catalog, the
// authenticator, or the request. An unauthenticated prober learns that a Shoal
// workspace process is up, which the open TCP port already tells it.
//
// The one optional route, /metrics, exists only when the host supplies a
// Config.Metrics writer, and that writer carries the disclosure obligation for
// what it emits (see Config).

// healthState is the readiness bit shared between the serving path and the
// health handler. It is false until the workspace is actually serving and
// false again as soon as shutdown begins, so a draining pod is removed from
// Service endpoints before it stops accepting connections.

//   - A panicking writer is a 500 with a fixed body. roleops lets the panic
//     reach net/http, which keeps the server alive but aborts the connection,
//     so the scraper sees a reset rather than a status it can alert on.
//
// The body is rendered completely before anything is written, so a writer
// that panics part-way never leaves a truncated exposition behind a 200.
//
// The writer also runs off the request goroutine, so that it cannot hold the
// listener's graceful close: a scrape still inside its writer when shutdown
// begins is answered 503 and its connection released, rather than keeping
// Drain waiting until its deadline. The writer itself is not interrupted — a
// function of a builder cannot be — and finishes into a buffer nobody reads.
