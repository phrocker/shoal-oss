// Package shadow is shoal's correctness oracle for compactions. Given a
// set of (inputs, iterator stack, scope) plus the RFile bytes Java
// produced from the same inputs, Compare runs the four-tier parity
// suite (T1 Java cross-read, T2 cell-sequence, T3 random point lookup,
// T4 metadata summary) and returns a structured Report.
//
// This package is pure over byte slices — no I/O, no goroutines. The
// Phase 2 service binary fetches bytes from GCS, calls Compare, then
// uploads the Report. Keeping the oracle pure means Phase 2's poller
// can race compactions in parallel without sharing state.
