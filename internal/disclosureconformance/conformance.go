// Package disclosureconformance asserts that a response surface does not vary
// with whether content was withheld from the caller.
//
// The property it checks is indistinguishability, not absence of a field. A
// caller who can separate "nothing matched" from "something matched and was
// withheld" can enumerate the existence of content it cannot read, by probing
// terms and watching the difference. That holds whether the difference is a
// count, a boolean, an error code, or a field that is present in one response
// and omitted in the other. Comparing the encoded forms catches all of them,
// including a field added later that nobody thought about.
//
// The suite is deliberately usable in both directions. A surface that
// deliberately discloses withholding declares itself Distinguishable, which
// pins the accepted trade so that changing it silently fails the suite rather
// than passing unnoticed.
