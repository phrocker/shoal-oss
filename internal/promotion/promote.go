// Promote reconciles manifest's required destination splits, stages its
// already-exported RFiles into a flat Accumulo bulk directory (computing
// and writing the Bulk Import V2 load mapping; see StageBulkDir and
// BuildLoadMapping), and then submits the bulk import through conn — in
// that order, each step failing closed before the next can run.
//
// Before any of that, Promote validates tableName/bulkDir and the whole
// manifest via validatePromotionDestination, a BuildLoadMapping
// preflight, and stagingPreflight -- all pure or local-probe-only checks
// that touch neither Accumulo nor dst; see the validation paragraph
// further below for exactly what each one catches and why running them
// first matters. Only once every one of those has passed does Promote
// turn to splits: for a multi-tablet manifest, it calls
// RequiredDestinationSplits (itself a pure, network-free check) and, if
// it reports any rows, submits them through conn.AddTableSplitsForTable
// -- the first call in a Promote run that can reach Accumulo or mutate
// anything. That reconciles the destination's real tablet
// boundaries to the exact rows BuildLoadMapping's widened KeyExtents
// reference, which Accumulo's own server-side
// PrepBulkImport.validateLoadMapping check otherwise requires to already
// exist. A single-tablet (or legacy) manifest requires no splits at all,
// so AddTableSplitsForTable is never called for one. Every Accumulo-facing step —
// AddTableSplitsForTable and BulkImport alike — goes exclusively through the
// manager's FATE machinery (TABLE_SPLIT and TABLE_BULK_IMPORT2
// respectively); Promote never edits tablet metadata directly, so the
// manager remains the sole authority over the promoted table's resulting
// tablet layout and file set.
//
// BuildLoadMapping's widening rule is only provably correct against
// Accumulo's own PrepBulkImport.validateLoadMapping walk when the
// destination's real splits, at or before the last required row, are
// exactly the required rows — no fewer (AddTableSplitsForTable already
// guarantees that) and, just as importantly, no more. An extra,
// unrelated split anywhere in that range — pre-existing or added by
// another actor between reconciliation attempts — silently changes the
// real predecessor row an earlier mapping entry leaves Accumulo's
// validation walk resting on, which the next entry's widened
// prevEndRow can then never re-match (see docs/promotion.md §3.2/§5 for
// the full trace). So immediately after AddTableSplitsForTable, Promote calls
// conn.ListTableSplits and runs verifyNoUnexpectedDestinationSplits: if
// the destination has any such extra split, Promote fails closed with a
// clear, actionable error before staging or submitting anything, rather
// than letting BuildLoadMapping construct a mapping that Accumulo's own
// validation would reject for reasons the failure would not explain. A
// trailing extra split strictly after the last required row is left
// alone by this specific check: it falls entirely inside the final,
// always-unbounded entry's own span, so it can never reproduce the
// prevEndRow mismatch described above. That is not the same as
// harmless in every sense a bulk import can fail, though: Accumulo's
// own PrepBulkImport.validateLoadMapping separately enforces
// table.bulk.max.tablets (default 100, admin-configurable per table,
// since Accumulo 2.1.0) by counting how many real destination tablets
// the final mapping entry's files overlap — a count trailing splits
// inflate directly. Enough of them can still make BulkImport reject
// the load mapping for a reason this package neither detects nor
// explains up front; Promote does not enforce that limit itself,
// since doing so accurately needs a way to read the destination
// table's actual (possibly non-default) property value, which the
// Promoter interface does not expose today — see docs/promotion.md §5
// item 3 for the full reasoning.
//
// This check narrows, but cannot close, the window for a concurrent
// structural change on the destination: a split or merge racing between
// verifyNoUnexpectedDestinationSplits succeeding and BulkImport's own
// server-side validation running could still invalidate the mapping
// Promote just staged. Accumulo's own defense against that is to reject
// the bulk import cleanly (a "concurrent merge" style failure), not to
// corrupt data, so this residual race is a safe-failure gap, not a
// correctness one — see docs/promotion.md §5.
//
// A table name is not a stable handle across that same window: Accumulo
// lets a table be deleted and a differently-scoped table created under
// the identical name, and AddTableSplitsForTable, ListTableSplits, and
// BulkImport each independently resolve tableName to a table ID on
// their own, through a cache with no enforced TTL (see
// internal/tablenames.Resolver). To guard against that, whenever splits
// are reconciled Promote pins the destination's real table ID via
// conn.ResolveTableID once, before calling AddTableSplitsForTable, and
// passes that same pin straight into it: AddTableSplitsForTable's own
// fresh resolve is checked against the pin before it makes any split or
// mergeability mutation, so a delete-and-recreate landing in the window
// between Promote's own pin and that call's internal resolve is caught
// there, before it can mutate the wrong table, instead of only being
// noticed afterwards (see accumulo.Connector.AddTableSplitsForTable's
// own doc comment for exactly what that check can and cannot close).
// Promote checks the same pin again, via verifyDestinationTableIdentity,
// immediately before BulkImport -- failing closed if tableName now
// resolves to a different table than the one splits were just
// reconciled against. This is a narrower, independent check from
// verifyNoUnexpectedDestinationSplits above: it catches an identity
// change even when the replacement table happens to end up with the
// same splits, and it covers the entire staging window, not just the
// AddTableSplitsForTable/ListTableSplits round-trip. See
// verifyDestinationTableIdentity's own doc comment for exactly what it
// can and cannot prove. A single-tablet (or legacy) manifest -- the
// "safe single-tablet staging" case this package already handled before
// destination split reconciliation existed -- has no reconciliation
// step to pin against and is deliberately left out of this check's
// scope: closing that pre-existing gap is unrelated to the multi-tablet
// slice this check exists for, and is tracked separately rather than
// folded in here.
//
// An empty load mapping (manifest.RFiles has nothing to import) stages an
// empty bulk directory but skips the BulkImport FATE call entirely:
// submitting a zero-file bulk import is a needless round trip to the
// manager for a no-op. Splits are still reconciled first if the manifest
// declares a multi-tablet chain, even when every tablet in it ends up
// empty, so a caller inspecting the destination afterwards sees the same
// tablet boundaries regardless of which tablets happened to carry files.
//
// Promote validates tableName and bulkDir, and the whole manifest --
// its tablet chain shape (via RequiredDestinationSplits), its RFiles'
// own references into that chain (via a BuildLoadMapping preflight:
// every RFile.TabletIndex must be declared, and a repeated
// DestinationPath must not disagree about which index it belongs to),
// and everything StageBulkDir itself would reject before writing a
// single byte -- including that every RFile actually exists at src and
// matches its recorded size/SHA256 (via a stagingPreflight call:
// engine.VerifyRFileExport, source-alias dedup, flattened-basename
// validity and uniqueness, and staging write-target aliasing against
// both src and dst; see stagingPreflight) -- before making any Accumulo
// call or writing anything to dst. Without the RFile-level check, a
// manifest whose tablet chain is well-formed but whose RFiles reference
// an undeclared index, or declare one DestinationPath under two
// conflicting indexes, would only be rejected later, inside
// StageBulkDir's own BuildLoadMapping call. Without the staging-level
// check, a manifest whose tablets and RFiles are otherwise well-formed
// but which references a missing or corrupt export file, flattens two
// different tablets' files to the same bulk-directory basename (or an
// invalid one), or aliases src or dst, would only be rejected later
// still, inside StageBulkDir's own verification and staging calls.
// Either gap, left unclosed, means AddTableSplitsForTable below would already
// have mutated the destination's real splits by the time a permanently
// unstageable manifest is finally caught. Running both preflights here
// first, and discarding their results, closes both gaps: a malformed
// manifest of any of these kinds, or an invalid destination, never adds
// a split, stages a file, or submits a bulk import before the call
// fails.
//
// The RFile-level and path/naming parts of these preflights are cheap
// to recompute -- StageBulkDir redoes its own equivalent chain/dedup/
// flatten/alias checks further on regardless, since every one of those
// calls is a pure or local-probe-only function of the manifest and the
// backends alone, so recomputing never observes a different
// destination state. engine.VerifyRFileExport is not cheap the same
// way -- it streams and hashes every RFile's actual bytes -- but
// Promote still lets StageBulkDir run it again below, deliberately, at
// the cost of hashing every RFile twice: AddTableSplitsForTable and
// verifyNoUnexpectedDestinationSplits/ListTableSplits, both of which
// run between this preflight and StageBulkDir, are a real manager
// round-trip taking arbitrary time, and src is not guaranteed
// immutable across it (a local path or an object-store key can be
// overwritten in place while that call is in flight). Skipping
// StageBulkDir's own verification to avoid the duplicate cost would
// leave that window unchecked: a source object replaced during
// AddTableSplitsForTable/ListTableSplits would be staged and bulk-imported
// without ever being verified against the manifest it actually matches
// at copy time (see stagingPreflight's own doc comment for the same
// reasoning from the staging side, and
// TestPromoteRejectsSourceMutatedDuringAddTableSplits for the
// regression test proving this window is closed).
//
// Promote does not itself retry on failure, and retry safety differs by
// which step failed. A failure in validation, AddTableSplitsForTable, or
// verifyNoUnexpectedDestinationSplits, verifyDestinationTableIdentity,
// or StageBulkDir (before BulkImport is ever called) is always safe to
// retry: split
// reconciliation is idempotent (AddTableSplitsForTable treats a row that
// already is a tablet's end row as already satisfied, refreshing only
// its mergeability metadata), the split-verification check is a
// read-only comparison, and staging is deterministic and copy-based, so
// calling Promote again with the same arguments reproduces the same
// destination splits, staged bytes, and loadmap.json. Once BulkImport
// has been invoked, a blind retry is not always safe: FATE submission
// has no built-in dedup/idempotency (see docs/promotion.md §5), so an
// ambiguous failure there — for example a timeout after the manager
// received the request but before the caller observed a response —
// leaves the caller unable to tell whether the bulk import already
// happened, and resubmitting risks a duplicate import.
