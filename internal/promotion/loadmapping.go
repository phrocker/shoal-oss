// Package promotion implements the client-side half of Accumulo's Bulk
// Import V2 protocol, used to promote an already-exported local Shoal
// table into an existing Accumulo cluster.
//
// Accumulo's manager is the sole authority over tablet metadata: promotion
// never edits accumulo.metadata or ZooKeeper directly. Instead this
// package:
//
//  1. Validates a manifest's declared tablet chain (one implicit tablet
//     for legacy manifests with no Tablets entries, or any number of
//     explicitly declared tablets forming a single gapless chain) and
//     derives a destination KeyExtent for each.
//
//     Shoal's local tablets use [StartRow, EndRow) (inclusive start,
//     exclusive end — see engine/table.go's routeTablet), while
//     Accumulo's KeyExtent is (PrevEndRow, EndRow] (exclusive start,
//     inclusive end — see KeyExtent.java's contains()). Copying split
//     boundaries verbatim would make rows whose value exactly equals a
//     split point land on opposite sides of the boundary in the two
//     systems, so each tablet's destination KeyExtent is deliberately
//     widened instead: PrevEndRow is set to the *previous* tablet's own
//     StartRow (one tablet further back), not to the tablet's own
//     StartRow, which provably never excludes a row that genuinely
//     belongs to that tablet. See RequiredDestinationSplits and
//     docs/promotion.md §3 for the full derivation and its safety
//     argument.
//
//     A single-tablet (or legacy) manifest still yields exactly one fully
//     unbounded KeyExtent, unchanged from before.
//
//  2. Stages those RFiles flat into a bulk directory — Accumulo's bulk
//     import lists the bulk directory non-recursively, so files must sit
//     directly inside it, unlike ExportRFiles' per-tablet nesting — and
//     writes the load mapping as loadmap.json, in the exact
//     Gson-compatible JSON shape Accumulo's BulkSerialize /
//     LoadMappingIterator expect.
//
//  3. For a multi-tablet manifest, the widened KeyExtents this package
//     computes only pass Accumulo's own server-side
//     PrepBulkImport.validateLoadMapping check if the destination
//     table's splits, at or before the last boundary row
//     RequiredDestinationSplits reports, are exactly those rows — no
//     fewer and, just as importantly, no more (an extra pre-existing
//     split in that range is not harmless here; see
//     RequiredDestinationSplits's own doc comment for why). Promote
//     reconciles the "no fewer" half by submitting those rows through
//     the existing accumulo.Connector.AddTableSplits — itself a manager
//     TABLE_SPLIT FATE operation, the same protocol
//     TableOperations.addSplits uses — and the "no more" half by then
//     confirming accumulo.Connector.ListTableSplits reports nothing else
//     in that range, both before staging or submitting the bulk import.
//     BuildLoadMapping and StageBulkDir themselves never call Accumulo: a
//     caller invoking them directly for a multi-tablet manifest, outside
//     of Promote, is responsible for that same reconciliation, or the
//     subsequent BulkImport call will fail closed (not silently) with a
//     concurrent-merge-style rejection.
//
//  4. Submits the TABLE_BULK_IMPORT2 FATE operation via
//     accumulo.Connector.BulkImport — the only other step that talks to
//     Accumulo, and it does so exclusively through the manager's FATE
//     machinery, preserving the manager as the sole authority over the
//     promoted table's resulting tablet layout and file set.
//
// See REFERENCES.md for the exact upstream Java sources this package
// mirrors, and docs/promotion.md for the protocol writeup, what this
// bounded slice covers, and what is intentionally deferred.

//
// A single-tablet (or legacy) manifest yields one fully unbounded
// KeyExtent{PrevEndRow: nil, EndRow: nil}, unchanged from before. A
// multi-tablet manifest yields one Mapping per tablet index that has at
// least one file (an index with zero files is silently omitted — there is
// nothing to place there), each keyed by a deliberately widened KeyExtent:
// EndRow is the tablet's own EndRow (always safe — the tablet's own
// exported data never reaches that row, by construction of Shoal's
// exclusive-end routing), but PrevEndRow is the *previous* tablet's own
// StartRow rather than this tablet's own StartRow, so that a row exactly
// equal to this tablet's inclusive start is never excluded by Accumulo's
// exclusive-start convention. See RequiredDestinationSplits — including
// why the destination must not have any *extra* split in the range that
// widening covers — and docs/promotion.md §3 for the full derivation.
// That widening means each
// returned Mapping's KeyExtent generally spans up to two adjacent source
// tablets' worth of destination range (index 1 widens all the way to
// unbounded, since there is no tablet before index 0 to anchor to — an
// acknowledged limitation, not a bug), so Accumulo may legitimately load
// a file against more destination tablets than the source tablet it came
// from; that is always safe, never a correctness issue, only a modest
// over-registration.
//
// RFiles sharing the same DestinationPath (e.g. a manifest listing one
// physical file more than once under the same tablet) contribute a single
// FileEntry: Accumulo's Bulk.Files is name-keyed and rejects duplicate
// filenames outright. A repeated DestinationPath under different
// TabletIndex values is rejected as ambiguous before any staging can omit

//
// Legacy manifests with no Tablets entries (RFileExportManifest.Tablets

// RequiredDestinationSplits returns the destination table's split rows, in

// no *other* splits at or before the last of these rows — before
// Accumulo's own server-side PrepBulkImport.validateLoadMapping check
// will pass. It performs the same tablet-chain validation
// BuildLoadMapping does, and fails the same way on a malformed
// manifest, but never touches storage or Accumulo itself: it is a pure
// function, safe to call standalone — for example to pre-create splits
// through accumulo.Connector.AddTableSplits before staging, which is
// exactly what Promote does.
//
// A single-tablet (or legacy) manifest requires no destination splits at
// all: BuildLoadMapping's fully unbounded KeyExtent matches Accumulo's
// outermost tablet boundaries (both nil) regardless of how many splits
// the destination already has, so this returns (nil, nil) for that case.
//
// For an N-tablet manifest (N>1), the required splits are exactly the N-1
// boundary rows shared by adjacent tablets (tablet i's EndRow, equivalently
// tablet i+1's StartRow, for i in 0..N-2): those are the only rows any
// widened KeyExtent BuildLoadMapping computes can ever reference. It is
// tempting to conclude from this that any *additional* pre-existing
// destination splits between these points are therefore harmless, since
// Accumulo's validateLoadMapping does let a single load-mapping entry
// span several destination tablets when that entry's declared
// PrevEndRow/EndRow are each matched by some existing tablet boundary.
// That conclusion is false for the overlapping, widened extents this
// package builds, and callers must not rely on it: validateLoadMapping
// walks the destination's tablets with a single, shared, forward-only
// iterator across every load-mapping entry in submission order, so a
// destination split strictly *before* the last required row leaves
// that iterator stopped one real tablet further forward than the next
// entry's widened PrevEndRow — always the row two boundaries back, by
// construction; see BuildLoadMapping — can match. The iterator can
// never rewind, so the whole submission is rejected with a spurious
// BULK_CONCURRENT_MERGE-style error even though nothing actually
// merged. A split strictly *after* the last required row is genuinely
// harmless: the final Mapping entry is always fully unbounded (nil
// EndRow) and absorbs it regardless of how many further splits exist
// beyond it.
//
// This function only reports what rows are required; it cannot detect
// an unsafe pre-existing split on its own, since it is a pure function
// over the manifest alone with no view of the destination's actual
// state. Promote separately verifies, via
// accumulo.Connector.ListTableSplits immediately after AddTableSplits,
// that the destination's splits at or before the last required row are
// exactly these rows — no more, no fewer — failing closed with a
// specific, actionable error before any staging or BulkImport call
// otherwise (see verifyNoUnexpectedDestinationSplits and Promote's own
// doc comment for the full mechanism). A caller invoking
// RequiredDestinationSplits or BuildLoadMapping directly, outside of
// Promote, is responsible for that same reconciliation itself, or for
// accepting that the subsequent BulkImport call may fail.
//
// Even with that verification in place, this says nothing about
// whether the destination will still have exactly these splits by the
// time a subsequent BulkImport call is validated server side: a
// concurrent split or merge on the destination between verification
// and bulk-import submission is a real, acknowledged race this package
// cannot close on its own (see docs/promotion.md §5) — Accumulo's own
