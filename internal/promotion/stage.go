// StageBulkDir copies every RFile referenced by manifest from src (the
// export destination backend, where Engine.ExportRFiles /
// ExportRFilesIncremental already placed them, nested under per-tablet
// directories) into bulkDir on dst as a FLAT directory, and writes the
// corresponding loadmap.json describing which destination KeyExtent each
// file belongs to. Accumulo's Bulk Import V2 lists the bulk directory
// non-recursively and expects every referenced file to sit directly inside
// it (see BulkImport.java's directory listing), unlike ExportRFiles' own
// t-NNNN/ nesting.
//
// Copies (rather than moves) so a failed or interrupted stage never loses
// the source export, and re-running StageBulkDir with the same manifest and
// bulkDir reproduces byte-identical files and an identical loadmap.json —
// safe to retry.
//
// Calls in this process that target the same recognized backend location and
// bulkDir are serialized. Promote holds that ownership through BulkImport, so another
// local promotion cannot overwrite verified files between publication of
// loadmap.json and submission of the import. Distributed callers still must
// assign one immutable bulkDir per promotion; storage.Backend has no portable
// conditional-create primitive from which to build a cross-process lease.
//
// Basenames must be unique across the whole manifest once flattened; a
// collision is reported as an error before any copy happens, rather than
// silently overwriting one file with another (see package docs for the
// deferred auto-rename gap, mirroring Accumulo's own renames.json step).
//
// bulkDir itself is preflight-validated before any read or write: empty,
// whitespace-padded, or backend-root destinations fail before staging can
// mutate dst, and dst itself must implement storage.WritableBackend (see
// validateDestinationWritable) or StageBulkDir fails before its first
// storage.Copy call, rather than deep inside it. BuildLoadMapping likewise
// rejects any manifest whose
// declared tablet chain is malformed (gaps, overlaps, duplicate or
// out-of-range indexes, missing or misplaced boundaries) before staging
// starts.
//
// StageBulkDir accepts multi-tablet manifests, but — unlike Promote — it
// never talks to Accumulo and cannot reconcile the destination's actual
// tablet splits. The widened KeyExtents BuildLoadMapping computes for a
// multi-tablet manifest are only guaranteed to pass Accumulo's own
// server-side load-mapping validation if the destination already has
// splits at RequiredDestinationSplits' reported rows; a caller invoking
// StageBulkDir directly for a multi-tablet manifest, bypassing Promote's
// orchestration, is responsible for ensuring that beforehand, or the
// eventual BulkImport call will fail closed (not silently) rather than
// stage or import anything incorrectly.
//
// The manifest is verified (engine.VerifyRFileExport: every RFile exists at
// src and matches its recorded size/SHA256) before anything is copied, so a
// truncated, corrupted, or stale export manifest fails fast here rather
// than silently staging incomplete or mismatched data for Accumulo to bulk
// import. That whole-manifest verification happens once, before the copy
// loop starts, and so cannot by itself catch a source file that changes
// *during* the loop -- for example a later file mutated while an earlier
// one is still being copied, or the same file mutated in the brief window
// between this check reading it and storage.Copy separately opening it
// moments later. Closing that window would require re-verifying every
// file again immediately before its own copy, which is exactly as
// expensive as just verifying after copying and additionally cannot
// detect corruption introduced by the copy path itself (see the next
// paragraph), so StageBulkDir instead verifies each file's *destination*
// object right after it is written.
//
// Concretely: immediately after each file's storage.Copy returns,
// StageBulkDir re-opens and re-hashes the object it just wrote at dst and
// compares that against the manifest's recorded size/SHA256 for that
// file, before continuing to the next file or writing loadmap.json. This
// is deliberately a check of the object actually sitting at dst, not a
// second read of src: it catches a source mutated after the up-front
// VerifyRFileExport pass but before (or during) its own copy, and it
// additionally catches corruption introduced by the copy/backend path
// itself (storage.Copy's own doc comment notes that some WritableBackend
// implementations buffer and upload on Close, so a copy can still fail or
// corrupt data after every prior Write appeared to succeed). Like the
// cancellation case below, a mismatch here is reported and staging stops,
// but the offending file's already-written (incorrect) bytes are not
// rolled back -- StageBulkDir is not atomic across a multi-file manifest
// in either failure mode, and loadmap.json is only ever written after
// every file has both copied and re-verified successfully, so a caller
// that only trusts a bulkDir with a present, successfully-written
// loadmap.json is never exposed to a manifest describing unverified
// bytes.
//
// That guarantee is about loadmap.json written by *this* call. A bulkDir
// can also already hold a loadmap.json left behind by an earlier,
// different StageBulkDir call -- for example a retry after a prior
// attempt succeeded, or an operator re-running staging against the same
// bulkDir. If this call's own copy loop then fails partway (storage.Copy
// itself failing, or the post-copy verifyStagedRFile check below
// rejecting a mismatched destination object), StageBulkDir returns an
// error without ever reaching WriteLoadMapping -- but without further
// handling, that OLD loadmap.json would be left completely untouched,
// still claiming the directory is complete and correct even though one
// of its RFiles was just overwritten with bytes that failed
// verification. StageBulkDir closes that window by invalidating any
// pre-existing loadmap.json immediately before this loop starts
// mutating any RFile; see invalidateExistingLoadMapping's own doc
// comment for the exact mechanism. A bulkDir with no pre-existing
// loadmap.json -- the common, fresh-destination case this whole
// function is primarily documented for above -- is unaffected by this:
// there is nothing to invalidate, and no extra write occurs.
//
// This means a full Promote call over a multi-tablet manifest reads and
// hashes every RFile up to three times: once in stagingPreflight (before
// AddTableSplits), once more in StageBulkDir's own preflight above (after
// AddTableSplits/ListTableSplits, before any dst write), and once again
// per file immediately after it is copied (reading dst, not src). Each
// pass closes a different, non-overlapping window and none of the three
// is redundant with the others: removing either upfront pass would allow
// an already-corrupt manifest to still cause partial writes to dst
// before being caught; removing the post-copy pass would leave the
// per-file copy-time window this paragraph describes wide open. The
// repeated hashing is a deliberate correctness-over-efficiency tradeoff
// for a manager-authoritative promotion path, consistent with the same
// tradeoff stagingPreflight's own doc comment already describes.
//
// Every write target is also preflighted before any copy starts: every
// flattened RFile destination plus loadmap.json is compared against
// every unique source path in the manifest, and every write target is
// compared against every other write target, and every unique source
// path is also compared against every other unique source path. That
// catches in-place staging (bulkDir is the export's own tablet
// directory), a destination reached through a symlink/hard link to a
// *different* RFile's source, aliased write targets such as two staged
// filenames (or a staged filename and loadmap.json) that resolve to the
// same location, and two manifest sources that are themselves the same
// physical file reached through two different DestinationPath spellings
// (for example a symlink/hard link, or a case/Unicode-normalization
// difference). If those aliases flatten to the same basename,
// StageBulkDir dedupes them to one staged file; if they flatten to
// different basenames, StageBulkDir rejects the manifest as ambiguous
// rather than staging the same physical file twice under different
// names for Accumulo to bulk import.
//
// Those aliases are dangerous because storage.Copy opens the destination
// for writing before it reads the source bytes: on backends like local,
// the first write would truncate the aliased file in place, silently
// corrupting a source export or previously written staging output before
// StageBulkDir ever notices. StageBulkDir rejects every such case up
// front rather than destroying any source or staging path.

// the RFile list alone. This mirrors BuildLoadMapping's own preflight,
// which Promote also calls once early and StageBulkDir recomputes
// again further on, for the same reason.
//
// engine.VerifyRFileExport is different: it streams and hashes every
// RFile's actual bytes, so it is not cheap to recompute the way the
// other three checks are -- but unlike them, StageBulkDir is still
// deliberately left to run it again on its own, rather than having
// Promote skip it there. AddTableSplits and ListTableSplits, which run
// between this preflight and StageBulkDir, are a real manager
// round-trip taking arbitrary time, and src is not guaranteed
// immutable across it: a local path or an object-store key can be
// overwritten in place while that call is in flight. Verifying only
// here and trusting it to still hold by the time StageBulkDir copies
// would leave exactly that window unchecked -- a source object
// replaced during AddTableSplits/ListTableSplits would be staged and
// bulk-imported without ever being verified against the manifest it
// actually matches at copy time. So this preflight's verification and
// StageBulkDir's own are deliberately redundant in the common case and
// each close a different, non-overlapping window: this one guards
// AddTableSplits against ever mutating the destination's splits for an
// export that was already corrupt before either call started;
// StageBulkDir's guards the copy itself against one that became
// corrupt (or was replaced) during the calls in between. See
// TestPromoteRejectsSourceMutatedDuringAddTableSplits for the
// regression test proving the latter window specifically.
