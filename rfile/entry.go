// Entry is one RFile cell: a key, its value, and the tombstone flag Accumulo
// stores alongside the key.
//
// It exists because accumulo.Key, which describes an entry a tablet server
// already resolved for a scan, has no tombstone flag, while an RFile is the
// level at which deletes are still visible: Sharkbite's KeyValue carries
// Key.isDeleted, and MergeOptions.ApplyDeletes and MergeOptions.Propagate are
// only meaningful for entries that can express one.
//
// Every []byte an Entry holds is copied on the way in and on the way out, so
// an Entry stays valid after the reader advances and a writer cannot observe
// a later mutation of the caller's buffers.

	// the same key and an older timestamp when the file is read with deletes
	// applied.

// A key that already carries accumulo.Key.Deleted produces a tombstone, so the

// own marker are set, so either one identifies the tombstone.

// before results are returned.
