package interaction

// Fold-style summarization, following the public `fold` semantics of
// github.com/phrocker/sag: a set of recorded interactions collapses into one
// compact vertex, and that vertex can later be unfolded back into exactly what
// it replaced.
//
// Three properties make the Shoal form of this safe rather than merely
// compact:
//
//   - A fold is derived content. Its node kind is in the reserved
//     interaction.* namespace, so every default-exclusion rule that applies to
//     a session applies to it unchanged. A model cannot retrieve a fold and
//     cannot cite one as though it were a source document.
//   - A fold's visibility is the conjunction of everything it folds: every
//     label of every folded session plus every label of every source node
//     those sessions touched. Summarizing can therefore only ever narrow
//     visibility, never widen it. Publishing a genuinely public redacted
//     summary is a separate, explicit, reviewed action, and it is deliberately
//     not implemented here.
//   - Unfolding is lossless with respect to provenance. The retrieved set and
//     the cited set are kept apart at every level, because the visibility
//     conjunction is only sound if it covers everything the model was shown,
//     not only what it went on to cite.
//
// A fold carries no summary text. It carries the digest of a summary held
// out-of-band, because the summary is derived from evidence and an interaction
// record may hold identities, digests, counts, and node IDs only.
