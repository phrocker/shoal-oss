// Package lexicon builds a graph-derived vocabulary bundle: the names,
// aliases and derived abbreviations of graph nodes, compiled into a token-level
// Aho-Corasick matcher that returns node IDs, plus lookup templates derived
// from ontology relationship definitions.
//
// A bundle is content-addressed (its ID is the SHA-256 of its canonical bytes)
// and pinned to the graph snapshot it was built from. It has one of two
// scopes. A server-filtered bundle may contain any node; every match must be
// filtered against the caller's current authorization before it is used or
// echoed, and the bundle's bytes cannot be exported. A pinned bundle is built
// from a node set that was already filtered for one authorization scope, names
// that scope's digest, and is the only kind that can be shipped.
//
// The package does no authorization itself: Candidates reports every overlap
// regardless of visibility, and Select must be given the caller's visibility.
// See pkg/explorer/authorized ResolveMentions for the composition.
