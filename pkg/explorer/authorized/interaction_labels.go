// Output labels on interaction and fold reads (#567, #568).
//
// An interaction record stores the output restriction its producer required
// of a reader (Session.RequiredVisibility), and the label expression stamped
// on its derived graph (Summary.Visibility, and the shoal.visibility metadata
// of each derived node and edge). The touched-source re-check every read
// already makes enforces each touched node's AccessRule, label policies
// included (#570); it does not enforce the output restriction, whose labels
// belong to no touched node (for example a workspace output policy).
//
// So every read here evaluates the record's output restriction with the
// reader label evaluator (label_visibility.go). A record the reader may not
// see is ObjectNotFound on a point read and absent from a list, so what an
// outsider receives is byte-for-byte what it would receive had the record
// never been written: no count, no placeholder, no "filtered" marker.
//
// Records are never partially withheld. One conjunction is stamped on every
// derived node and edge, and turns carry no labels of their own, so there is
// nothing finer to withhold.
//
// The label expression. #574 withheld it from every reader that did not
// record the session, because no read could yet ask whether a reader held
// the labels it names. The evaluator answers that, so the recorder rule is
// replaced by the question itself: the expression is shown exactly when the
// reader may see every term it names. Its free-form node labels translate to
// the touched nodes' label policies (which the touched-source re-check has
// already required of the reader) and its structured terms are decided as
// they stand. A reader who may see the record but not the whole expression
// (a trusted service whose ceiling lacks a touched node's label, or a record
// whose producer kept an output label out of RequiredVisibility) receives
// the record with the expression cleared exactly as an unlabelled record
// stores it.
//
// A fold is visible only when every member session is and the reader may see
// the fold's own visibility, which conjoins every member's expression. So a
// visible fold's expressions are all permitted and are returned unchanged.

// readableInteraction returns record as the reader may see it, and false when
// the reader may not see it at all. record has already passed the touched
// source re-check (or the recorder check for a tombstone or zero-hit record).
