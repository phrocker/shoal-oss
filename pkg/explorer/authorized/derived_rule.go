// Extracted registrations (RegistrationExtracted) are bound to the document
// revision that asserted them. Their effective rule is their own rule AND the
// asserting document's current rule, exactly as revisionAllows governs an
// older revision: when a document is relabelled, the entities and relations
// extracted from it close with it (#570). An extracted registration whose
// document has no current registration, or whose conjoined rule cannot be
// built, is dropped, which every caller treats as unregistered and denied.
//
// Every other kind keeps its registered rule: intrinsic (document) nodes and
// edges always name the current revision, and materialized and application
// registrations are not derived from any document. The decision is made on
// the stored RegistrationKind, never on which fields happen to be empty.

// effectiveNodeRegistrations applies the extracted-registration rule to node
// registrations. It runs where node registrations are resolved (resolveNodes,
// authorizedNode, the lexicon batch).
