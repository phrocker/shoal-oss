// defends against the mosaic effect: individually authorized results that, in
// aggregate, disclose something an identity is not cleared to infer.
//
// Every authorized result belongs to a sensitivity domain derived from the
// access rule that governs it (see AccessRule.sensitivityDomain). A single
// domain is always disclosed once authorized; the budget bounds only how many
// *distinct* domains one identity may observe together within a window.
// MaxDomains is that bound. Once an identity has locked in MaxDomains distinct
// domains, further results from a not-yet-observed domain are withheld until
// the window elapses.
//
// A zero MaxDomains disables the control, preserving the pre-mosaic behavior.
// Window must be positive when the control is enabled.

// authorized to read but that the mosaic co-occurrence budget withheld to keep
// the identity within its distinct-domain budget.
