// The change feed is built on the durable, monotonic publication sequence that
// Ingest already assigns to every applied revision (see lastPublicationSequence
// in IngestWithOptions and its recovery in loadDocumentRecord). That sequence,
// not the content-digest Snapshot.Frontier, is the feed's clock: the digest can
// only tell two corpus states apart, it cannot order them or answer "everything
// after X". The publication sequence is a total order over document
// publications and survives restart, which is exactly what a resumable cursor
// requires.
//
// The feed reports document publications only. Application edges (Connect) are
// stamped with wall-clock PublishedAt, which is neither monotonic nor
// restart-distinct, so there is no authoritative order across edges to fold
// into the same cursor; interaction and fold records are deliberately excluded
// from the corpus frontier entirely. Inventing a single global order across
// those kinds would be a fiction, so this is an honest per-kind (document)
// feed.
