// Package evidencelabels holds the one definition of "may this reader see
// evidence carrying these visibility labels" for evidence that is *stored*
// rather than scanned.
//
// These labels are enforced nowhere else, and the reason first given for this
// package said otherwise. It said label enforcement in this plane happens at
// the scan — that a document a reader may not see does not come back from
// storage, so no service-layer filter was needed, and an evidence reference
// merely escaped that.
//
// That does not hold for the free-form labels an evidence reference carries.
// interaction.PropertyVisibility ("shoal.visibility") is written into a
// node's *properties* by explorer.setVisibility, reached from parse.go, and
// never into a cell visibility — so the scan has nothing to filter on and
// internal/visfilter never sees it. Authorized reads gate on the access
// rule's domain, source and policy, so a reader granted a source receives
// every labelled document, span and node in it, label included (#570).
//
// So Filter is not restoring a check that existed at a lower layer. It is the
// only check, which makes the nil case load-bearing rather than defensive: a
// deployment with no Visibility withholds labelled evidence precisely because
// nothing else would.
//
// An evidence reference recorded on another record — a dispatch action
// (#369), or the lifecycle event published for it (#562) — was recorded by
// that record's principal and is stored as a field of it, so it is returned
// to whoever may read the record rather than to whoever holds its labels.
// Every such path filters through Filter here, so the rule cannot drift
// between them.
//
// A leaf package on purpose: the dispatch plane and the event plane both
// import it, and neither imports the other for it.

// ceiling. A free-form label is held by nobody, which is why Translator

// Translator rewrites, at record time, the visibility an evidence reference

// An executor reports the visibility of the nodes it retrieved as their

// decision holds such a label, so a reference stored with one is withheld
// from every reader, holders included. Since #570 each such label is enforced
// as a structured policy per (source, label) conjoined into the node's
// AccessRule, and that policy's grant labels (d:, s:, g:) are what a reader
// can be shown to hold. Translator replaces each free-form term with them.
//

// it was, so the reference stays withheld rather than opened.

// Filter returns the values the reader behind ctx may see, in order, and

//
// The rule, which is the whole of #369's decided shape:
//
//   - A value with no visibility expression is kept. It carries no label to
//     lack, so withholding it would redact something nothing asked to be
//     protected — and that is what keeps this from gutting the grounding every
//     deployment without labels relies on.
//   - A nil evaluator withholds every labelled value. A plane that cannot
//     evaluate a label must not hand out the identifiers the label exists to
//     protect.
//   - A labelled value the evaluator says the reader may not see is dropped
//     whole. There is no count of what was dropped, and the caller must not
//     return one: a count that disagrees with the list is an existence oracle
//     for the rest (#398). A partial list is therefore not a completeness
//     claim — a reader cannot tell "recorded no evidence" from "recorded
//     evidence you may not see".
//   - An evaluator error is returned, not treated as a redaction, so a
//     transient fault is not indistinguishable from a permanent refusal.
//
// values is never modified. When nothing is withheld the input slice itself is
// returned with withheld false.
