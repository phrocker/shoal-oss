// the authorization vocabulary rather than against a list someone remembered to
// update.
//
// A lifecycle audit's AuthorizationOperation decides whether the activity feed
// treats it as fleet activity or as a user interaction. OperationExecute was
// missing, so every claim or completion authorized under it — the whole point
// of #437 — was classified as a user interaction and surfaced beside its own
// fleet_action entry.
//
// Written as a complete partition of the operations an action's lifecycle can
// carry, so adding a fleet operation without classifying it fails here.
