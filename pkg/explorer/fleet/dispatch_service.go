	// always the enqueuer and no record needed to say so; every record written

// and already clamping ClaimLeaseUntil. So the total bound needs no new
// concept and no new ceiling.
//
// Four semantics, each decided rather than discovered.
//
// The fence does not increment. ClaimFence identifies *which* claim, and the
// claim has not changed — only its deadline has. Incrementing would invalidate
// the fence the claimant is holding and break the report-under-the-same-fence
// contract the gateway design depends on. The record Version increments
// instead, and ExpectedVersion guards the mutation.
//
// An expired lease is not renewable, and that is the point rather than a
// limitation. Once ClaimLeaseUntil has passed the action may already have been
// reclaimed under a new ClaimID and fence, so renewing would hand two workers
// a live claim. A worker whose extension is refused mid-operation is in the
// ambiguous case — it may be about to perform, or have performed, an effect it
// can no longer report — which is what EffectPossible and the #438 ambiguity
// route exist for. The refusal is ErrClaimLost, distinguishable from a
// transport failure, because a worker must be able to tell "my claim is gone,
// treat this as ambiguous" from "retry the renewal".
//
// Shortening is refused. A lease moving ClaimLeaseUntil backwards is a worker
// bug, and honouring it costs the claim it was trying to keep.
//
// And no lifecycle event is published. A heartbeat on a long operation would
// emit one every few minutes per action and drown the event log in liveness;
// ClaimLeaseUntil and Version already carry it and Status already exposes
// them. TransitionKind is empty, so the store writes without enqueuing an
// outbox row — which also keeps a renewal out of the mixed-identity outbox
