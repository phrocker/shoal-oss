// Admission answers the one question no other surface in Shoal answers: an
// out-of-process caller holding a side effect it has not yet performed asking
// whether it may perform it.
//
// Every other enforcement surface here adjudicates work Shoal itself does, and
// every other control *withholds* — it removes evidence from a response that is
// produced anyway. A caller about to post a prompt to a hosted model cannot
// withhold: it does not assemble the response, and by the time content exists
// the transmission has already happened. It needs a decision before the effect,
// which is what this is.
//
// It is deliberately not a new durable object. An admission is a dispatch
// action in the claimed state, and the token is its claim: the same store, the
// same fence, the same lifecycle events, the same audit phases, the same replay
// semantics. That is not an economy — it is the same situation. A remote worker
// that has claimed an action and a proxy that has been admitted are both
// out-of-process actors holding permission Shoal granted and has not yet seen
// the outcome of, and inventing a second record for the second case would have
// given the two different durability, different reconciliation, and a second
// place for the two to disagree.
//
// Nothing here enforces that a caller honours what it is told. It cannot: no
// plane outside the caller's own process can. This is a declaration seam of the
// same kind as the execution boundary, and a caller that ignores an obligation
// is misreporting its own configuration exactly as a host that binds an
// external-effect executor under an evidence-only ceiling is.

// It does keep two principals that choose the same name in two different
// records. That is its job, and an unkeyed digest does it: the derivation only
// has to be collision-free across principals, not unpredictable.
//
// It does *not* make another principal's identity unguessable, and it never
// could. The inputs are a workspace and a set of identities, which are knowable
// in most deployments, and the digest is unkeyed — so anyone who knows the
// tuple computes the result. The property the previous version claimed, that
// "neither can address the other's", did not hold: addressing a record does not
// require this surface. A caller could compute the victim's derived ID, submit
// it to dispatch enqueue as an ordinary action ID, and learn from conflict
// versus success whether it was occupied — and squat unheld ones, denying the
// victim its own admission by name.
//
// Keying the digest would have hidden the ID without making it unreachable, and
// an identifier's secrecy is not access control: anything that ever leaks one —
// a log line, an expired token, a record read through another surface — hands
// back the reachability. It would also need a durable secret with a rotation
// story, and rotation re-derives every live admission's identity, orphaning
// outstanding grants whose tokens no longer resolve. A reserved namespace costs
// none of that and gives the stronger property, so the secrecy claim is gone
// and the reserved namespace carries the weight.

// what authorizedCurrent compares when it decides a record belongs to a caller.
