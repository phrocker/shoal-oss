// An action registered with RequiresAttestation may be claimed only by a
// principal that holds a current verified attestation for the descriptor's
// executor ref, and only for a lease the attestation covers. This file holds
// the seam the fleet consumes (ExecutorAttestations, AttestationTrust), the
// one gate predicate every claim grant passes through (attestationGate), and
// the presentation service behind POST /api/v1/fleet/executors/attestation.
//
// The fleet does not verify anything itself. internal/executorattest does,
// and cmd/shoal-explore-web adapts it to these interfaces, so this package
// stays free of the trust file, the verifier keys and the store.
