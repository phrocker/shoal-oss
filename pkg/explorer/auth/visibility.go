// SplitVisibilityConjunction converts the &-joined expression form of a stored
// label set into the term-slice form VisibilityPermittedForUser and
// VisibilityPermittedForService accept.
//
// Stored label sets appear in both forms. interaction.Session.RequiredVisibility,
// fleet.EvidenceRef.Visibility and the fold member visibilities hold a slice
// of terms; the persisted interaction and fold records hold the same set
// rendered by interaction.Expression, which joins the sorted terms with '&'.
// Neither form has disjunction: interaction.Conjoin is the only constructor.
//
// The split is on '&' alone and never trims or interprets anything else, so a
// '|', a parenthesis or whitespace stays inside a term, and the evaluator
// refuses that term as malformed. An empty piece (from "a&&b", a leading or a
// trailing '&') is kept as an empty term, which is also malformed. Only the
// empty expression is the unlabelled set, returned as nil.

// VisibilityPermittedForUser decides whether a user decision may see data
// stored with the conjunction labels, without a policy catalog and without a
// scan. It answers for stored (not scanned) labelled fields the question the
// tablet answers for cells (#564). A decision carrying a service role is an
// error here: it must be asked through VisibilityPermittedForService, so that
// neither call site can be read as the other.
//
// labels is a conjunction: every term must pass, and an empty set is
// unlabelled, which every valid decision may see. Each term must be a
// structured grant label from the policy grammar:
//
//   - d:<domain> passes when domain is the decision's authorization domain;
//   - s:<source> passes when source is a permitted source;
//   - g:<policy>:e:<epoch> passes when policy is a permitted policy, at any
//     epoch. A decision carries logical grants only, and AccessRule.Authorize
//     already treats physical epochs as not participating in object
//     authorization, so a record stamped at an older epoch stays visible to a
//     reader still granted its logical policy;
//   - svc:<role> never passes for a user.
//
// A free-form term (for example an ingest label such as "secret") is held by
// no decision and is false, as is a malformed term: one corrupt stored record
// must not fail a whole list, so it is withheld rather than reported.
//
// Visibility is deliberately coarser than authorization. It reads only the
// operation-invariant fields of the decision (authorization domain, permitted
// source and policy IDs, service role) and never Authorize, preflight or the
// allowed operations: the consumer has already authorized the operation on
// the record, and this answers only whether the record's stored labels are
// within the reader's grants.
//
// The only errors are an invalid decision, one expired at now, and a decision
// in the wrong mode. The answer depends only on fields AuthorizationFingerprint
// already hashes and the stored labels.

// additionally bounded by its ceiling, exactly as DeriveScannerAuthorizations
// bounds it: the ceiling must be configured and be the one the decision names
// (identity and role), and every term must be within it. Ceiling membership is
// exact for every term, g:<policy>:e:<N> included, matching the tablet and
// DeriveScannerAuthorizations. The older-epoch rule applies only to the
// decision's logical grants, never to the ceiling: an operator who rotates a
