// AskExecutor is the production fleet.ActionExecutor for grounded reasoning.
// It runs one registered agent action through the authorized reasoning path
// that already backs recorded chat, so tool use, retrieval, visibility, and
// interaction recording remain bound to the request's trusted decision. The
// executor adds no model, tool, or storage authority of its own: it decodes a
// bounded question, delegates, and translates the verified citation envelope
// into dispatch evidence.
//
// It deliberately refuses any response that is not finalized, durably
// recorded, and verified, so a dispatch action can never commit a successful
// effect over an answer the reasoning path did not ground.
//
// What the record carries is bounded separately from whether the answer is
// grounded. The dispatch evidence bound counts members rather than anchors,
// and a cited document anchor costs three, so a record holds at most 85 of
// them while the reasoning harness allows far more. Anchors a claim cites are
// packed first and the receipt reports what was left out. Failing the action
// instead would discard a verified answer that the chat path returns happily,
// after the model call was already billed; the complete grounding stays
// durably recorded in the interaction session the receipt names.
//
// The invoking decision must carry auth.OperationRetrieve in addition to
// auth.OperationInvoke: the reasoning service authorizes retrieval on its own
// terms. A principal granted only invoke and dispatch fails every action with
// AskErrorReasoningUnauthorized, which separates an authorization refusal from
// a model or transport failure but does not identify which refusal it was.
//
// Action output is a receipt, not the answer. DispatchService.Status, Pull and
// TeamActions authorize a reader on (domain, source, policy, object) and apply
// no visibility-label check before serializing an ActionRecord, so anything
// this executor writes there is readable by a principal who does not hold the
// source labels. Claim values, issue reasons, ontology identifiers, and the
// effective output label expression are all derived from retrieved documents,
// so none of them belong in Output. The receipt reports only what the
// execution did; the verified claims stay reachable through the
// visibility-enforcing interaction path using the recorded session ID.
//
// ActionRecord.Evidence is the larger surface and is not addressed here: it
// carries citation identifiers, offsets, and label expressions past the same
// unenforced read path. Each reference records its own Visibility, but no
// reader applies it. That gap belongs to the dispatch read path rather than to
// this executor and is tracked by issue #369.
