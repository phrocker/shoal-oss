// hostAuthority is the central host-authority gate: an exact-match allow-list of
// the authorities a request may address. Every request must present a Host
// (HTTP/1.1) or an :authority (HTTP/2, which Go surfaces through Request.Host)
// that matches one configured authority exactly — the hostname compared
// case-insensitively and the port compared exactly.
//
// The match is deliberately exact. There is no wildcard, no suffix, and no
// X-Forwarded-Host or Forwarded matching; each of those is a classic
// Host-authority bypass. A deployment behind a reverse proxy that legitimately
// answers to more than one name lists each name explicitly.
//
// Enforcing this before routing bounds cache poisoning, absolute-URL/redirect
// poisoning, virtual-host confusion, and DNS rebinding against a
// private-network listener, regardless of whether any individual handler
// derives a URL from the request host today.
