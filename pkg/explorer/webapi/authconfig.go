// publiclyReachable is the fail-closed allowlist of request lines the transport
// serves without a trusted decision. It is expressed as an allowlist consulted
// before authenticate, so a route that is not named here is authenticated by
// default: a contributor who adds a new /api/v1/* handler gets authentication
// for free and cannot make it public by omission.
//
// The match is exact on method+path for the two named routes and a single
// prefix for the immutable asset tree. The prefix is "/assets/" only, which can
// never overlap an "/api/v1/*" path, and the whole predicate is gated to GET,
// so no state-changing route is ever reachable unauthenticated. The request
// path is cleaned before matching, so a traversal such as
// /assets/../api/v1/documents is judged as the API route it resolves to, not as
// an asset, and remains authenticated.
//
// The path.Clean call is load-bearing and non-obvious, so it must not be
// removed. net/http hands ServeHTTP the raw, un-normalized request path, but the
// ServeMux that routes the request afterward cleans it. Without the Clean here
// the gate and the router disagree about which route a request is: the gate
// would see /assets/../api/v1/meta as an asset and skip authentication, then the
// mux would resolve it to the real /api/v1/meta handler. That disagreement is
// the vulnerability, and it is invisible from reading either the gate or the mux
// alone. Cleaning here makes the gate judge the same route the mux will serve.
// TestPubliclyReachableNormalizesTraversal and
// TestAuthGateAuthenticatesTraversalIntoAPIRoutes pin this in both directions.
//
// This does not bypass the host-authority gate, which runs first and
// unconditionally in ServeHTTP; it only decides whether authentication is
// required for a request the host gate has already admitted.
