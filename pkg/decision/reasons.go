// Whole-request reasons the decision service establishes itself.
//
// These name facts about the *service's* own adjudication: that it found the
// evidence ineligible and ran nothing, that the predictor it was configured
// with was unavailable or was not the predictor the request pinned, that its
// own deadline computation fired, that the call returned an error, or that the
// response it got back was not a valid prediction.
//
// They are reserved (ReservedServiceReason), so a predictor may not return
// one. Without that, a predictor returning "evidence_ineligible" produced a
// stored result reading "the service found the evidence ineligible and ran no
// predictor" — which was false, and nothing in the record distinguished the
// two (#509).
//
// Reserving rather than recording an origin is deliberate. An origin field
// makes the misattribution legible; reserving makes it unrepresentable, needs
// no new persisted field on every stored result, and lets a reader take the
// reason at face value: if it is one of these, the service established it. A
// predictor with its own view of the same situation says so in its own words,
// which is more honest anyway — its judgement that evidence was unusable is
// not the service's eligibility gate.
