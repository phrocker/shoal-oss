// TestTheGatewayRenewsOnTheFenceAfterAFormerHoldersReport (#629): a claim
// lapses and is re-claimed; the displaced former holder reports its
// ambiguity, which moves the record's version and leaves the new claim
// alone; the current holder, still holding the version its claim returned,
// renews on its fence and the renewal lands. A renewal that pinned the
// version it holds would be refused here, stranding the live claim. The
// former holder's own renewal is refused as fence_lost.
