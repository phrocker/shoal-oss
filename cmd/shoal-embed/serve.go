// writes, and vice versa. If ctx ends first (deadline or cancellation),
// Stop force-closes the HTTP server and force-stops the gRPC server
// (aborting connections and cancellable RPCs).

// while that goroutine, and the listener it owns, were technically still

// RunUntilSignal is the production entry point for a shoal-embed serve

// readiness-polling consumer can observe /readyz before anything actually
// stops accepting work), and a Stop bounded by drainTimeout. It does not
// return until that sequence has finished, whether successfully or with an
// explicit timeout error describing why engine close was skipped.
//
// That covers one real early-exit race: Serve only reflects
// grpc.Server's own internal stop bookkeeping — it says nothing about the
// *additional* work this package's Stop wrapper does around that (waiting
// for the HTTP server to finish shutting down, then closing the engine).
// Those can still be in progress, e.g. blocked on a slow HTTP request or a
// non-cancellable unary RPC, when Serve returns. A caller that reacts to
// Serve returning by exiting the process (returning from main, for
// example) can therefore terminate every other goroutine, including the
// one still finishing Stop, before that work is done.
//
// It also covers the same race from the other direction: Serve can return
// a non-nil error *before* sigCh ever fires — either because the signal
// arrives (or, as here, was already queued) early enough that this
// method's own Drain/quiesce/Stop sequence stops the gRPC server before
// Serve is even called (grpc.Server.Serve returns grpc.ErrServerStopped
// immediately if the server is already stopped when it's invoked), or
// because of a genuine, signal-independent fatal accept error. Both the
// signal arriving and Serve returning are therefore raced against each
// other explicitly, via select, rather than left to chance: Serve runs in
// its own goroutine so a pending signal — even one already queued before
// this method is called at all — can be observed without first waiting
// for Serve's goroutine to be scheduled and to actually execute, so a
// signal that raced ahead of Serve is reliably still recognized as the
// reason for shutting down rather than mistaken for a Serve failure.
// Whichever wins, this method runs the Drain/quiesce/Stop sequence
// exactly once. On a clean Stop it also waits for Serve's goroutine to
// return before returning, so a caller can never see this method return
// and exit while shutdown work is still in progress. If Stop instead
// returns a shutdownTimeoutError because non-cancellable unary RPCs were
// still in flight at the drain deadline, this method propagates that
// explicit error immediately rather than waiting indefinitely for Serve to
// unwind. A signal-triggered shutdown therefore reports success (nil) only
// when Stop finishes cleanly; a genuinely signal-independent Serve failure
// still reports its real error after the resulting Drain/Stop has
// completed so the engine and HTTP server are never left open.
