# Veculo-on-shoal graph schema

`internal/graphschema` defines shared byte conventions for modeling an
agentic memory graph on top of shoal's generic `row -> (cf,cq,cv,ts) -> value`
cells. It is a consumer library only: the engine and `internal/iterrt` remain
schema-agnostic.

## Cell layout

| Purpose | Row | Column family | Column qualifier | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Event node | `evt:<id>` | `content:` | consumer-defined | event text |
| Event/entity embedding | `evt:<id>` or `ent:<name>` | `vec:` | consumer-defined | packed big-endian `float32` vector |
| Attribute | any node row | `attr:` | attribute key | attribute value |
| Temporal edge | source node row | `edge.temp:` | neighbor/target id | empty or big-endian `float32` weight |
| Causal edge | source node row | `edge.causal:` | neighbor/target id | empty or big-endian `float32` weight |
| Semantic edge | source node row | `edge.sem:` | neighbor/target id | empty or big-endian `float32` weight |
| Entity edge | source node row | `edge.ent:` | neighbor/target id | empty or big-endian `float32` weight |
| Term posting | `idx:<term>` | consumer-defined | primary id | optional posting payload |

## Four disentangled graph views

The edge families are separate on purpose:

- `edge.temp:` is the temporal backbone between adjacent or nearby events.
- `edge.causal:` captures cause/effect links.
- `edge.sem:` captures semantic similarity or inferred affinity.
- `edge.ent:` captures event/entity and entity/entity relationships.

Because each view has its own column family, a scan or pushdown request for one
view can seek only that family. With shoal locality groups and sorted keys, this
keeps single-view scans cheap and avoids mixing temporal, causal, semantic, and
entity traversals in one large edge namespace.

## Mapping to pushdown requests

- `VectorSearch`: set `embedding_cf` to `graphschema.VectorCF()`. Query vectors
  and embedding values use packed big-endian `float32`, matching
  `proto/embed.proto`.
- `EdgeExpand`: set `edge_cf` to `graphschema.EdgeCF(kind)`. This schema stores
  the neighbor id in the column qualifier, so use the default `edge_field`
  (`"qualifier"`), no field separator, and set `primary_prefix` to the target
  row namespace when targets are ids rather than full rows.
- `TermFilter`: build posting rows with `graphschema.TermRow(term)`. This schema
  uses the posting cell's column qualifier as the primary id, matching the
  default `id_source` (`"qualifier"`). Set `primary_prefix` to
  `[]byte("evt:")` for event postings, or leave it empty if postings store full
  row keys.

## Temporal backbone via sorted ULIDs

Event row keys are `evt:<id>`, and event ids are expected to be lexically and
temporally sortable, such as ULIDs. That makes the primary event rowspace itself
a coarse temporal index: range scans over `evt:` return events in time order
while `edge.temp:` cells add explicit local jumps across the temporal graph.
