    'longer exists.** Two rows are excluded and carry other statuses: '
    '[SB-STAT-028](#sec-14) (`Not required` — a pybind11 registration defect in the '
    '`TableRates` property table, not a capability) and [SB-STAT-038](#sec-14) (`Missing '
    'Go` — a Python `dynamic_attr` property of the objects rather than a protocol '
    'capability). Accumulo commit `f0841e4` removed `getManagerStats`, '
    '`ManagerMonitorInfo`, and `DeadServer` together with the legacy monitor resources — '
    '113 commits before the pinned Accumulo 4 target `317c288`. The surviving REST-v2, '
    'metrics, and server APIs cannot reconstruct the `AccumuloInfo` / '
    '`TabletServerStatus` / `TableInfo` / `TableRates` / `TableCompactions` / '
    '`Compacting` / `RecoveryStatus` / `DeadServer` object graph these rows describe: the '
    'data is either absent, aggregated differently, or exposed only as scrape-time '
    'metrics without the per-table and per-server structure Sharkbite returns. The status '
    'label keeps the words `approval required` because [§4.2](#sec-4) fixes the six '
    'status names; whether a divergence *is* approved is recorded in [§26](#sec-26), '
    'never in the status column. The approval covers exactly the 82 rows in this section, '
    'which already carried this status, so it changed no classification and no count. The '
    'entry point that reaches them, [SB-CONN-007](#sec-7), is named by the decision in '
    '[§26](#sec-26) but is **not** one of the 82 approved rows: it keeps `Missing Go`, '
    'because what it owes after the approval — a shim that raises — is buildable Python '
    'work ([SB-GAP-P-006](#sec-23)). Moving it would require an approval that names it. '
    'This is therefore **not** a Shoal implementation gap that effort can close, and it '
    'must never be marked `Missing Go` (which implies it is buildable) or `Covered`. '
    'Shoal issue [#96](https://github.com/phrocker/shoal-oss/issues/96) attempted it and '
    'PR [#98](https://github.com/phrocker/shoal-oss/pull/98) was **withdrawn** for this '
    'reason. The single approval decision governing them is [SB-DIV-016](#sec-26), and it '
    'covers the 82 capability rows of this section — neither [SB-STAT-028](#sec-14) nor '
    '[SB-STAT-038](#sec-14) is in it. **Approved — @phrocker, 2026-08-19.** The decision '
    'is recorded on Shoal issue '
    '[#81](https://github.com/phrocker/shoal-oss/issues/81#issuecomment-5343583850) and '
    'mirrored here by revision {revision}, as [§26](#sec-26) requires. The approved '
    'compatibility behavior is normative: 1. `connector.getStatistics()` **raises '
    '`NotImplementedError`** with a stable explanation that Accumulo 4 removed the legacy '
    'manager-monitor API. The explanation is part of the contract: it does not vary with '
    'the cluster, the credentials, or the call. 2. It **must not** return a fabricated or '
    'partially populated status object. No `AccumuloInfo`, `TabletServerStatus`, '
    '`TableInfo`, `TableRates`, `TableCompactions`, `Compacting`, `RecoveryStatus`, or '
    '`DeadServer` instance is ever returned, so none of the accessors below is ever '
    'reachable and no metrics-scraped substitute may be presented as one. The approval '
    'fixes the observable contract of the call, not how a shim is written internally: it '
    'says nothing about what an implementation may construct or attempt on the way to '
    'raising, and this document does not add such a rule. 3. This permanent absence '
    '**must not** be surfaced as a retryable `ClientException` ([§18](#sec-18)). A caller '
    'must be able to distinguish "the cluster is unavailable, retry" from "this API no '
    'longer exists". 4. **Capability discovery must not advertise cluster-status '
    'support.** No `shoal_capabilities` bit, no ABI export, and no Python feature flag '
    'may claim it ([SB-XCUT-012](#sec-20), [SB-GAP-C-006](#sec-23)). The approval '
    'satisfies the [§2.2](#sec-2) gate for these rows under corollary 5 of [§2](#sec-2). '
    'It does **not** make any row `Covered`, and it does not erase the work it creates: '
    'the Python shim owes the raising entry point, and the compatibility suite owes the '
    'tests that pin it ([SB-GAP-T-009](#sec-23), [SB-GAP-P-006](#sec-23)) — that '
    '`getStatistics()` raises `NotImplementedError` with the stable message and not '
    '`ClientException`, that no status object is returned on any path, and that '
    'capability discovery reports no cluster-status capability. Two separate facts, which '
    'this document deliberately does not conflate. First, **each of the 82 rows '
    '[SB-DIV-016](#sec-26) covers keeps `Intentional divergence (approval required)` '
    'permanently**: [§4.2](#sec-4) fixes the six status names, approval state lives in '
    '[§26](#sec-26) rather than in the status column, and an approved divergence records '
    'a capability that will never exist. Landing the tests does not move those 82 rows, '
    'and neither does anything else — only reversing the approval could. The claim is '
    'about them and not about the section: [SB-STAT-028](#sec-14) is `Not required` and '
    '[SB-STAT-038](#sec-14) is `Missing Go`, and neither is bound by this permanence. '
    'Second, and independently, the divergence is **approved but unproven** until '
    '[SB-GAP-T-009](#sec-23) lands: the decision is binding now, the evidence that an '
    'implementation obeys it does not exist yet. Proof status is not a classification and '
    'never becomes one.'

    'is dormant rather than blocking, carries no approver of its own, and revives only if '
    'that approval is reversed. Every remaining entry blocks the gate until a named '
    'approver signs it with a date. Approvals are recorded on Shoal issue '
    '[#81](https://github.com/phrocker/shoal-oss/issues/81) and then mirrored into this '
    'table in the same change; a comment on #81 alone does not lift the gate, and neither '
    'does an edit here without the corresponding #81 decision. Adding a divergence to '
    'this table is not approval. **87 matrix rows currently carry the `Intentional '
    'divergence (approval required)` status: 82 are approved and 5 are not.** The '
    'approved 82 are the cluster-status rows of [§14](#sec-14), all covered by the single '
    'decision [SB-DIV-016](#sec-26), which @phrocker approved on **2026-08-19**; that '
    'decision also governs [SB-CONN-007](#sec-7), the `getStatistics()` entry point, but '
    'does not cover it as an approved row, so it stays `Missing Go` and is counted there. '
    'The unapproved 5 are SB-PKG-014 (Accumulo 4 only), SB-CFG-014 and SB-CFG-022 (no '
    'password read-back, both spellings), SB-CONN-010 (per-connector pools), and '
    'SB-ERR-003 (no Thrift types); each of those still blocks the gate exactly like an '
    'unimplemented row. The table below lists 16 decisions — 1 approved, 1 subsumed by '
    'that approval, and 14 still proposed — because one decision can cover many rows; the '
    'row count and the decision count are different quantities and must not be conflated. '
    'The remaining 14 entries — every decision except the approved [SB-DIV-016](#sec-26) '
    'and the subsumed [SB-DIV-013](#sec-26) — are **proposed** divergences. Approving one '
    'has one of two effects on a row it names. The 5 rows that already carry `Intentional '
    'divergence (approval required)` — the unapproved rows listed above, named by '
    'SB-DIV-001, SB-DIV-002, SB-DIV-003, SB-DIV-004 — would simply have their gate '
    'lifted, with no status and no count change, exactly as happened for the 82 rows of '
    'SB-DIV-016, which already carried this status when it was approved. Every other row '
    'a proposal names currently carries a different status and would move to `Intentional '
    'divergence`. Rejecting a proposal leaves its rows as gaps that must be implemented. '
    'Neither of the two non-proposed entries is a proposal: SB-DIV-016 is already '
    'approved, and SB-DIV-013 describes a capability that same approval removed outright, '
    'so it has nothing left to propose. SB-DIV-016 names [SB-CONN-007](#sec-7) as the '
    'entry point that reaches its rows, but that row is outside the approved set and '
    'keeps `Missing Go`; reclassifying it would require an approval that names it. An '
    'approved divergence never becomes `Covered`: it records a capability that will never '
    'exist rather than one that has been delivered, and its rows keep the `approval '
    'required` label because [§4.2](#sec-4) fixes the six status names — approval state '
    'lives in this table, not in the status column.'
