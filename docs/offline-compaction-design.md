# Offline compaction of Accumulo-hosted tablets — design

Status: **implemented**. Orchestrator, OFFLINE fence + guarded commit,
verification, and the `shoal-offline-compact` CLI have all landed (todos
`oc-*`). Operators should start with the runbook:
[`offline-compaction.md`](./offline-compaction.md).

## 1. Goal

Let shoal perform a **major compaction of a tablet whose table is
offline**, end to end, from a standalone Go binary — no tserver, no
manager, no compaction coordinator in the loop — and commit the result
back into `accumulo.metadata` safely.

This is the offline counterpart to the online `shoal-compactor`
(`cmd/shoal-compactor`), which today connects to the coordinator but
**stops at the metadata-commit boundary** because a non-manager process
has no write authority over `accumulo.metadata` / `accumulo.root` while
a tablet is live.

## 2. Why offline is the safe path

The online commit problem is a **concurrency + authority** problem: while
a tablet is hosted, its tserver is the single writer of that tablet's
file set, and only the manager (via Ample + the metadata-constraint
iterators) may mutate `file:` refs. Bypassing that risks the exact
"authority bleeding" wedge called out in the `shoal-compactor` file
header.

Taking the table **OFFLINE removes the concurrent writer entirely**:

- No tserver hosts any tablet of an offline table, so nothing else is
  reading or rewriting the tablet's RFiles or its metadata row.
- The tablet's `file:` column set is quiescent — it cannot change under
  us between the moment we read it and the moment we commit.
- Accumulo's own bulk-import / clone / export tooling relies on the same
  offline invariant, so we are reusing a well-understood safety envelope
  rather than inventing one.

That single invariant — **table is OFFLINE for the whole operation** —
is what makes a non-manager metadata commit defensible. Everything in
this design exists to *establish, fence, and preserve* that invariant.

## 3. Safety model

### 3.1 The OFFLINE fence

The table state lives in ZooKeeper (`/accumulo/<iid>/tables/<id>/state`,
value `OFFLINE` / `ONLINE`). The orchestrator:

1. **Fenced read**: read the state znode **and set the watch in the same
   ZK call** (`getData(path, watch=true)`), capturing both the value and
   the znode `Stat` (specifically `stat.version` and the read's `zxid`).
   Abort unless the value is exactly `OFFLINE`. Registering the watch in
   the same call as the read closes the classic watch race — a state
   flip between a separate read and a later watch registration cannot
   slip through, because there is no gap between them.
2. **Session-expiry is a fence failure**: if the ZK session expires (or
   disconnects long enough to lose the watch) at any point during the
   run, the operation aborts before commit (fail-closed). A lost session
   means we can no longer prove continuity, so we treat it as a
   definite fence trip rather than assuming OFFLINE held.
3. **Re-check at commit**: immediately before the metadata mutation,
   re-read the state znode and require **both** (a) value still exactly
   `OFFLINE`, and (b) `stat.version` **unchanged** from the fenced read
   in step 1. The version check is the real guard — ZK watches are
   one-shot and "the watch never fired" alone does not prove the absence
   of an intermediate ONLINE→OFFLINE round-trip; an unchanged
   `stat.version` does (any state write bumps the version).

This is a compare-and-swap in spirit: the CAS guard is the tuple
(value==`OFFLINE`, `stat.version` unchanged, session never lost) from the
fenced read through commit. If anyone onlines the table mid-run — even
transiently and back — the version advances and we throw the work away
rather than commit against a possibly-hosted tablet.

> We deliberately do **not** try to compact online tables by racing the
> tserver. If the operator wants online compaction, that is the separate
> coordinator-driven path and requires the Java-side `CompactionCommit`
> RPC (out of scope here).

### 3.2 Full-major semantics

Offline compaction is always a **full major compaction**: all of a
tablet's input RFiles are merged into exactly one output RFile, and the
output is the tablet's sole remaining file. This is the only mode where
`DeletingIterator` may legally drop tombstones (see `compaction.Spec.
FullMajorCompaction` and `iterrt` `DeletingIterator` Init contract), and
it keeps the metadata mutation trivial: replace the entire `file:` set
with one entry.

Partial/selection compactions (merge a subset) are a later extension;
they complicate delete propagation and are not needed for the primary
use case (shrink a tablet's file count / apply a stack offline).

### 3.3 GC-safe input dereference

We never delete input RFiles from the volume directly. The commit
removes the input `file:` refs from the tablet's metadata row; Accumulo's
garbage collector reclaims the now-unreferenced files on its normal
cycle. This matches how the manager's own commit path behaves and avoids
a shoal-side file-deletion authority claim.

### 3.4 Dry-run by default

The CLI defaults to **dry-run**: it performs the full read + compaction +
verification and prints the exact metadata mutation it *would* apply
(input refs to delete, output ref to insert), then exits without
touching metadata. A real commit requires passing `--dry-run=false`
*and* a passing OFFLINE fence. (`--dry-run` is the single source of
truth for the commit gate; see §7 for the flag list — there is no
separate `--commit` flag.)

### 3.5 Rollback

The output RFile is written under a fresh, unique name (`A<uuid>.rf`
convention) *before* the metadata mutation. The metadata mutation is the
single linearization point:

- If we crash **before** the mutation: the orphan output file is
  unreferenced and GC reclaims it. Inputs are untouched. No-op.
- If we crash **during/after** the mutation: the mutation is a single
  conditional batch (see §4.3). It either landed atomically or it did
  not; on restart the orchestrator re-reads the tablet's file set and
  is idempotent (if it already sees the single output file, it treats
  the tablet as done).

## 4. Architecture

Reuses existing, already-tested components; the new code is orchestration
+ commit + verification glue.

        ▼

```

### 4.1 `internal/offlinecompact` (new package)

Pure-ish orchestrator. Given `(tableID, optional row range, options)`:

1. Fence pre-check (§3.1).
2. `Walker` enumerate target tablets.
3. For each tablet: resolve majc stack (itercfg), fetch inputs
   (storage), `compaction.Compact`, write output.
4. Verify (§5).
5. Fence re-check, then commit (§4.3) unless dry-run.

Kept free of I/O primitives it does not own — it composes `metadata`,
`storage`, `itercfg`, `compaction`, and `zk` rather than reimplementing
them.

### 4.2 Output file naming

Match Accumulo's convention so the file is indistinguishable from a
Java-produced one: full major compaction outputs are named `A<base>.rf`
in the tablet's directory (`<volume>/tables/<id>/<tabletDir>/`). We
generate `<base>` from a UUID to avoid collisions.

### 4.3 The metadata commit — decision required

Two candidate mechanisms; **the CLI supports both, defaulting to the
conservative one until we have soak time on direct mode.**

**Mode P (plan, conservative, default):** emit a machine-readable commit
plan (per tablet: extent, input refs to delete, output ref + size +
entry count to insert). An operator applies it with Accumulo's own
tooling (a small `accumulo shell` script or a supplied Java applier that
uses Ample). Write authority never leaves Accumulo. Slower UX, zero new
trust claim.

**Mode D (direct, faster, opt-in):** shoal writes the `accumulo.metadata`
mutation itself as a **conditional mutation** — the batch is guarded by
a condition on the tablet's current file set (the exact input refs we
read), so if metadata changed underneath us the conditional write is
rejected server-side. Combined with the OFFLINE fence this is safe, but
it *is* a shoal-side metadata write, so it stays opt-in behind
`--commit-mode=direct` and starts life gated in docs as "advanced".

> Recommendation: ship Mode P first (unblocks the workflow with zero
> authority risk), land Mode D behind the flag once `oc-e2e` has soak
> coverage. This is the one open decision for `oc-commit`.

## 5. Verification (`oc-verify`)

There is no Java "expected output" for a fresh offline compaction (Java
never ran it), so we cannot use the shadow oracle's T2/T3 cross-diff
directly. Instead we layer three independent checks:

1. **Self-consistency (primary gate):** independently re-scan the *input*
   RFiles through the *same* iterator stack in a second pipeline and
   assert the emitted cell sequence is byte-identical to the output
   RFile's cell sequence. This catches writer bugs, block-boundary
   corruption, and stack non-determinism.
2. **Shadow oracle, shoal-only mode:** run `shadow.Compare` with
   `JavaCellsSourced=false` to get T1 (self-read: the output RFile is
   re-openable and fully scannable) + T4 (per-file summary sanity:
   cell count, CF histogram, first/last key).
3. **Optional Java cross-read:** if `SHOAL_JAVA_RFILE_VALIDATE` is
   configured, run the real Java RFile reader over shoal's output to
   prove Java can consume it (the T1 tier's external validator). This is
   the strongest single assurance that the offline output is a
   first-class Accumulo RFile.

Verification runs in dry-run too, so operators can gain confidence before
ever committing.

## 6. Iterator-coverage precondition (link to Workstream B)

Offline compaction can only run a tablet whose entire majc stack is
covered by shoal iterators. `itercfg.ResolvedStack.Skipped` lists any
`table.iterator.majc.*` class with no shoal port. If `Skipped` is
non-empty the orchestrator **aborts that tablet** (never silently drops
an iterator — that would corrupt semantics).

Closing that gap is exactly what the **iterator forge** (Workstream B,
`if-*`, see `iterator-forge-design.md`) does: it ports the missing Java
iterators to Go and widens `itercfg.ClassAllowlist`. The two workstreams
are complementary — A is usable today for allowlisted stacks; B expands
the set of tables A can service.

## 7. CLI surface (`cmd/shoal-offline-compact`)

```
shoal-offline-compact \
  --zk <quorum> --instance <name> \
  --table <name|id> [--range <startRow>:<endRow>] \
  [--dry-run=true]              # default true: plan+verify, no commit.
                               #   Pass --dry-run=false to actually commit
                               #   (this is the ONLY commit gate flag).
  [--commit-mode=plan|direct]  # default: plan. Only consulted when
                               #   --dry-run=false.
  [--verify=true]              # default: run §5 checks
  [--out <dir>]                # where to write the commit plan (Mode P)
```

Exit non-zero if: table not OFFLINE, any target tablet has a Skipped
iterator, verification fails, or the fence trips.

## 8. Testing (`oc-e2e`)

Two layers:

**Hermetic pipeline test (implemented, runs every build).**
`internal/offlinecompact/e2e_test.go` wires the real
Run → verify → Commit → apply → "online + full scan" cycle against an
in-process model of the pieces a cluster provides (RFile store, tablet
enumerator, majc-stack resolver, an `accumulo.metadata` model with a
conditional applier, and the **real** fence continuity predicates
`requireOffline` + `verifyContinuity` driven off a mutable table-state).
It covers: Mode D full cycle, the Mode P plan JSON hand-off to an
out-of-band applier, the ONLINE-round-trip version-guard trip at commit,
ONLINE-at-fence refusal, and an unported-iterator abort. This is the gate
that a full-scan of the committed output equals the original data
(post-versioning) and each tablet collapses to a single `file:` entry.

**Cluster-backed test (follow-up, out of the unit suite).**
Against a Mini/real Accumulo instance:

1. Ingest known data, flush + compact a few times to create multiple
   RFiles per tablet.
2. Offline the table.
3. Run `shoal-offline-compact --dry-run=false` (Mode P applied via the
   test's Ample applier; Mode D exercised directly).
4. Online the table.
5. Full scan; assert every original cell is present and correct, and the
   tablet now has a single `file:` entry.
6. Negative tests: table left ONLINE ⇒ abort; a table with an unported
   iterator ⇒ abort with the Skipped class named.

## 9. Decisions

- **D-1 (commit mechanism):** **DECIDED — Mode P default + Mode D
  opt-in.** shoal ships the conservative plan-emit path as the default
  and keeps metadata-write authority inside Accumulo; the direct
  `MetadataCommitter` seam is opt-in (`--commit-mode=direct`) and errors
  clearly until a committer is wired. We do not go direct-only.
- **D-2 (range compaction):** **DECIDED — range compaction is
  supported.** `--range` selects whole tablets that intersect the given
  row range (tablet granularity, never sub-tablet); an empty `--range`
  compacts the whole table. See `SelectTablets`.
