# Shoal Explorer evaluation plan

> **Status:** proposed release methodology.
>
> **Fixture root:** `testdata/explorer-eval`.
>
> This plan evaluates public document, graph, and retrieval behavior. It is
> backend-, storage-, transport-, parser-, and model-neutral. It does not
> depend on private indexes, embeddings, prompts, storage layouts, or Explorer
> implementation details.

## 1. Conformance language and capability labels

`MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `SHOULD`, and `MAY` are normative in this document.
Every assertion carries one of these capability labels:

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **CURRENT-CONTRACT** | Directly testable through the current public contracts in `pkg/document`, `pkg/graph`, or `pkg/retrieval`. |
| **CURRENT-BLACK-BOX** | Testable today through a product adapter without assuming internal implementation. |
| **PROPOSED-V2** | Defined by the delivered `proposed-evaluation-v2` fixture and evaluator contract, but not necessarily exposed by the current public API. |
| **FUTURE** | Requires a new public capability, fixture channel, or scale pack before it can be a release gate. |

An implementation MUST NOT report a **FUTURE** check as passing by substituting
an internal field, a model judgment, or a weaker proxy.

### 1.1 Public-contract boundary

The current public contracts support these direct assertions:

- **CURRENT-CONTRACT:** document and revision identity; half-open source ranges;
  document hierarchy shape; graph node, edge, and path structure; request text,
  modes, top-K, direct document scope, and as-of time; result ordering; evidence
  citations and graph paths; errors, cancellation, and deadlines.
- **CURRENT-CONTRACT:** `document.SourceRange` is half-open `[Start, End)`.
- **CURRENT-CONTRACT:** `document.SourcePosition.Offset` is a content offset.
  The public contract does **not** guarantee that it counts UTF-8 bytes.
- **CURRENT-CONTRACT:** retrieval is all-or-error. A public `Response` has no
  partial-result status and no authorization-oracle metadata.
- **CURRENT-CONTRACT:** current gRPC retrieval evidence is citation-shaped.
  A graph-only result with only graph-native evidence is therefore
  `not_evaluable_future_anchor_contract` through current gRPC until a public
  graph-native anchor exists.

The fixture deliberately defines stronger semantics:

- **PROPOSED-V2:** fixture citation offsets are zero-based, half-open UTF-8 byte
  ranges. Exact byte tests validate fixture or future-contract semantics, not
  the current meaning of `SourcePosition.Offset`.
- **PROPOSED-V2:** execution state, authorization policy, strategy, filters,
  principal scopes, stable result IDs, relevance grades, and cache-probe
  controls are evaluator fields.
- **FUTURE:** partial execution, runtime authorization metadata, and a public
  graph-native remote evidence anchor.

### 1.2 Current public `Request` mapping

Each current expectation maps to one public retrieval request. The exceptions
are the explicitly labelled **FUTURE** public principal and filter capabilities,
which require proposed adapter behavior today, and the non-evaluable `q14` and
`q19` schema probes.

| Fixture field | Public mapping | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `query` | `retrieval.Request.Text` | **CURRENT-CONTRACT** |
| `request.modes` | Concrete modes map to `retrieval.Request.Modes`; empty-mode semantics are not prescribed | **CURRENT-CONTRACT** except `q14`, which is **FUTURE** |
| `request.top_k` | `retrieval.Request.TopK` | **CURRENT-CONTRACT** |
| `request.as_of` | `retrieval.Request.AsOf` | **CURRENT-CONTRACT** |
| `request.scope.document_ids` | `retrieval.Request.Scope.DocumentIDs` | **CURRENT-CONTRACT** |
| `request.strategy` | Harness declaration used to select and verify modes | **PROPOSED-V2** |
| `request.principal` | Authorization context supplied by the adapter | **PROPOSED-V2**, **FUTURE** public API |
| `request.filters` | Adapter filter controls | **PROPOSED-V2**, **FUTURE** public API |
| `request.cache_probe` | Evaluator sequencing metadata, not request payload | **PROPOSED-V2** |
| `request.neighborhood` | No current public request field or neighborhood operation | **FUTURE** |

`q14-public-default-semantics` is **FUTURE** and
`not_evaluable_current_public_contract`. It activates only when a target
advertises a versioned default-mode contract and exposes the effective modes
used for the request. Until then, Explorer and CLI adapters materialize
concrete modes, and current evaluation does not prescribe empty-mode behavior.

`q19-future-fan-out-10` is also **FUTURE** and
`not_evaluable_current_public_contract`. The current public retrieval request
can scope graph node IDs, but it cannot request a bounded one-hop neighborhood.
The case activates only when a target advertises a versioned bounded graph
neighborhood contract and exposes the effective modes used.

`q10-unauthorized-error` maps `scope.document_ids:
["amber-lag-runbook"]` and `filters.revision_ids: ["r1"]` to exactly one
immutable revision and one public `Request`. It is not an evaluator-only hidden
identity.

For current all-or-error adapters:

- a successful response maps to `execution_state: complete`;
- an error maps to `execution_state: error`;
- no current response may be synthesized as `partial`;
- authorization filtering may still be `complete` for that principal.

## 2. Evaluation principles

1. **Falsifiable before executable.** Every metric MUST define a population,
   numerator, denominator, comparison rule, and empty-population behavior.
2. **Exact oracles before similarity.** IDs, ranges, revisions, authorization,
   path continuity, and ordering use deterministic comparison.
3. **No hidden implementation assumptions.** Only normalized inputs, public
   outputs, fixture records, and declared run metadata may affect a verdict.
4. **No-model baseline first.** Lexical, tree, graph, temporal, and policy
   behavior MUST have a deterministic baseline that invokes no generative
   model.
5. **Independent modes.** Lexical, vector, tree, graph, and declared hybrid are
   evaluated separately. Hybrid success cannot mask a failing constituent
   mode. The future default-mode probe is excluded until its activation
   contract is satisfied.
6. **Two independent parsers.** Candidate ingestion and reference validation
   MUST use parsers with different implementations and no shared parsing
   lineage. Shared libraries for byte reading or hashing are allowed; shared
   AST, sectionization, range, or hierarchy logic is not.
7. **Visible output only.** Hidden oracle data is evaluator input and MUST
   never be required candidate output.
8. **No security averages.** One authorization leak fails the release,
   regardless of aggregate quality.
9. **Pairwise coverage is a floor.** Every supported pair of declared matrix
   values MUST occur; specifically risky combinations also require explicit
   higher-order cases.
10. **Reproducibility.** Dataset hash, parser identities, configuration hashes,
    build identity, random seed, clock, machine profile, and warm/cold state
    MUST be recorded.

## 3. Canonical fixture and sole normative schema

The delivered fixture inventory is:

```text
testdata/explorer-eval/
  README.md
  corpus/
    adr-004-quartz-ring.md
    amber-lag-runbook.txt
    aster-relay-protocol-r1.md
    aster-relay-protocol-r2.md
  expectations.jsonl
  graph.jsonl
  hierarchy.jsonl
  relationships.jsonl
```

`README.md` is the schema authority. `expectations.jsonl` contains only
`semantics: "proposed-evaluation-v2"`. The following is the one normative
schema used by this plan; objects are closed and reject every unlisted field.
`T[]` is an array, `T?` is optional, and `null` is JSON null.

The delivered fixture contains 4 document revisions, 10 citation-backed
relationships, 1 hierarchy with 5 nodes, 1 graph snapshot with 18 nodes,
15 edges, 2 paths, and 19 expectations. Seventeen expectations are currently
evaluable; `q14` and `q19` are future/not-evaluable contract probes.

### 3.1 Required schema invariants

A strict validator MUST accept every delivered non-empty JSONL record and MUST
reject missing fields, extra fields, wrong types, duplicate identities, invalid
references, or any strategy/mode combination not listed below:

| Strategy | Exact modes |
| --- | --- |
| `lexical-only` | `["lexical"]` |
| `vector-only` | `["vector"]` |
| `tree-only` | `["tree"]` |
| `graph-only` | `["graph"]` |
| `declared-hybrid` | `["lexical","vector"]` |
| `public-default-semantics` | `[]` |

Every case has `top_k > 0`. `q14-public-default-semantics` is the sole permitted
empty-modes case. It uses `FutureExpected`, is **FUTURE**, and is not
evaluable under the current public contract. Its null current oracles mean
"not evaluated," not another execution or authorization state. It has no
current result, relevance, ranking, hard-gate, or release-decision assertion.
Activation requires target advertisement of a versioned default-mode contract
and observable effective modes.

`q19-future-fan-out-10` also uses `FutureExpected`. Its
`snapshot_oracle_id: "oracle:graph-fan-out-10"` references a deterministic
fixture oracle with exactly 10 outgoing edges from `node:fanout-hub`, exactly
10 paired leaf nodes, and ascending edge-ID order. Fixture structure and oracle
determinism are currently evaluable. Target neighborhood results, relevance,
ranking, latency, and release behavior are not: the current public contract has
no bounded-neighborhood operation. Those checks activate only with the
versioned bounded-graph-neighborhood contract and observable effective modes.
Its declared request is `top_k: 10` with root `node:fanout-hub`, direction
`outgoing`, `max_depth: 1`, and `max_fan_out: 10`.

`q05-section-hierarchy` is the required genuine tree-only case. It evaluates a
section heading and document ancestor from `hierarchy.jsonl`, has no graph
relationship expectation, and cannot be passed by retrieving a `part_of`
relationship.

For `CurrentExpected`, `results_exact` is capped by `top_k`. Every result has a
stable ID, type, target, one or more evidence memberships, grade, and tie group.
Ranking tiers exactly partition results. Multi-document evidence remains
attached to its result; retrieval metrics deduplicate by `result_id`, never by
document alone.

### 3.2 Fixture mechanical gate

The validator MUST fail on any violation listed by the fixture README,
including:

- malformed JSONL, unknown fields, blank records, duplicate IDs, or missing
  references;
- corpus path escape, BOM, CR byte, invalid UTF-8, missing final LF, length or
  hash mismatch;
- citation slice/quote mismatch or citation assigned to the wrong section;
- hierarchy containment, depth, sibling overlap, or parent discontinuity;
- graph and relationship temporal or path discontinuity;
- result/evidence/ranking inconsistency;
- effective revision selection outside `[valid_from, valid_to_exclusive)`;
- an invalid one-second fixture tick or wrong `q17`, `q03`, or `q18` revision;
- an authorization-filtered case labelled partial;
- positive results when `task_answerable` is false;
- visible evidence requiring scopes absent from the principal;
- `q13` or `q15` omitting a restricted node, edge, or path from the complete
  authorized-query closure;
- a fan-out oracle with a count other than 10, a discontinuous edge/leaf pair,
  an additional outgoing hub edge, or nondeterministic edge order;
- `q19` referencing an oracle other than `oracle:graph-fan-out-10` or lacking
  its future bounded-neighborhood activation contract;
- `q14` or `q19` containing a current result, relevance, ranking, execution,
  authorization, or target release-gate oracle;
- either cache ordering absent or mispaired; or
- evaluator-only data made mandatory in candidate output.

The validator MUST also run mutation tests that independently remove, add,
rename, and mistype each field family. A validator that only accepts the
positive fixture without rejecting these mutations does not pass.

## 4. Dataset construction and parser independence

### 4.1 Delivered gold provenance

The synthetic corpus, hashes, ranges, relationships, hierarchy, graph snapshot,
and expectations are adjudicated gold. A change to any gold record requires:

1. a human-readable rationale;
2. regeneration by a reference tool independent of candidate ingestion;
3. review of the exact byte diff;
4. successful strict validation; and
5. a new dataset content hash in run metadata.

Gold MUST NOT be generated from the candidate system under test. Model output
MUST NOT silently rewrite deterministic gold.

### 4.2 Source format and parser are separate dimensions

Source format and parser identity MUST NOT be conflated. The delivered corpus
contains Markdown and plain text. The support relation is versioned and records
each `(source_format, candidate_parser)` combination as `supported`,
`unsupported`, or `experimental`. Unsupported combinations are excluded from
quality denominators but MUST be listed; silently dropping them fails fixture
completeness.

Run metadata is external to the normative fixture schema. It MUST record:

| Field | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Dataset | Fixture semantic version and whole-tree content hash |
| Source | Format, encoding, newline policy, byte length, and content hash |
| Candidate parser | ID, version, configuration hash, and implementation lineage |
| Reference parser | ID, version, configuration hash, and implementation lineage |
| Gold | Adjudication revision, adjudicator role, and provenance hash |
| Support relation | Version and status for every format/parser pair |
| Execution | Build ID, adapter ID, transport, storage profile, mode, seed, clock, and machine profile |

The candidate and reference parser MUST have no common AST, heading extraction,
sectionization, source-range, or hierarchy implementation lineage. Acceptance
requires both:

- candidate output equals adjudicated gold; and
- independent reference output equals adjudicated gold.

Candidate/reference agreement alone is insufficient because both may be wrong.
Disagreement is a hard ingestion failure until adjudicated.

### 4.3 Dataset splits

| Split | Purpose | Visibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fixture | Fast deterministic contract and regression checks | Public |
| Development | Tuning and diagnostics | Public to implementers |
| Blind release | Unbiased release gate | Queries hidden until evaluation |
| Challenge | Adversarial parsing, temporal, authorization, and fan-out cases | Partially hidden |
| Scale | Performance and capacity only; quality gold sampled | Generated from fixed seed |

Logical document or revision families MUST remain in one split. Near-duplicate
content MUST NOT cross development and blind splits.

## 5. Coverage matrix

### 5.1 Dimensions

The run manifest MUST enumerate these independent dimensions:

| Dimension | Minimum values |
| --- | --- |
| Source format | Markdown, plain text, each newly supported format |
| Parser | Every supported candidate parser; one independent reference parser |
| Revision | Single, multiple, before boundary, exact boundary, after boundary |
| Mode | Lexical, vector, tree, graph, declared hybrid; public default is FUTURE/non-gating |
| Evidence | Citation, hierarchy-native, graph-native, multi-document |
| Authorization | Public, authorized restricted, filtered, direct-identity denied |
| Execution | Complete, error; partial once publicly supported |
| Transport | Embedded, remote |
| Storage | Every advertised storage adapter/profile |
| Cache state | Cold, same-principal warm, both cross-principal orderings |
| Scale | T0, T1, T2; T3 when release-supported |
| Graph fan-out | 1, 10, 100, 1,000 or declared supported maximum |

Pairwise coverage MUST include every pair among supported values. A
machine-generated pairwise coverage report MUST list covered and missing pairs.
No unsupported pair may be silently counted as covered. `q14` and `q19` are
excluded from current target pairwise coverage until their activation contracts
are satisfied.

### 5.2 Mandatory higher-order cells

Pairwise coverage does not replace these explicit cases:

- revision boundary x direct scope x unauthorized principal;
- tree-only x hierarchy-native evidence x Markdown;
- graph-only x graph-native evidence x no document citation;
- graph-only x hidden restricted intermediate x unauthorized principal;
- authorized warm x unauthorized probe x shared cache;
- unauthorized first x authorized control x shared cache;
- embedded x remote x each independently tested mode;
- each source format x each supported parser x citation boundary;
- multi-document evidence x deduplication x tied ranking; and
- high fan-out x as-of filter x authorization filter.

The last cell is **FUTURE** until the bounded-neighborhood contract required by
`q19` activates; its deterministic fan-out-10 fixture oracle is validated now.

## 6. Metric definitions

All metrics are computed per case and macro-averaged by case unless a weighted
average is explicitly named. Reports MUST include raw counts and per-mode,
per-format, per-transport, per-storage, and per-authorization slices. `q14` and
`q19` are excluded from every current target metric population, denominator,
relevance metric, and per-mode slice.

Unless a metric below defines a stronger empty-set rule, a zero denominator is
reported as `not_applicable` and excluded from macro-averages; it is never
coerced to a passing value. For exact set comparisons, two empty sets score
`1`, and exactly one empty set scores `0`.

Let `G_q` be expected stable result IDs for query `q`, `R_q@k` the first `k`
deduplicated returned result IDs, and `rel_q(r)` the gold grade in `[0,3]`.

### 6.1 Ingestion correctness

```text
Document acceptance = accepted supported inputs / supported inputs
Document identity accuracy = exact document IDs / gold document IDs
Revision identity accuracy = exact revision IDs / gold revision IDs
Content integrity = exact normalized content hashes / gold hashes
Section extraction F1 = 2 * section_precision * section_recall
Unsupported-format accuracy =
  correctly rejected unsupported inputs / unsupported inputs
```

Normalization MUST be declared and MUST NOT alter fixture bytes used by
citations. Duplicate input tests verify idempotent identity rather than merely
matching counts.

### 6.2 Hierarchy quality

```text
Node precision = matched hierarchy nodes / candidate hierarchy nodes
Node recall = matched hierarchy nodes / gold hierarchy nodes
Parent accuracy = nodes with exact parent / matched non-root nodes
Depth accuracy = nodes with exact depth / matched nodes
Ancestor-path accuracy = exact root-to-node paths / gold root-to-node paths
Range containment = nodes contained by parent / non-root nodes
Sibling non-overlap = non-overlapping adjacent sibling pairs / sibling pairs
```

Matching uses stable hierarchy node identity, then exact heading, range, type,
and revision. `q05-section-hierarchy` is the fixture gate.

### 6.3 Citation byte-range accuracy

For fixture bytes `B` and citation `[s,e)`:

```text
Exact byte accuracy = count(B[s:e] == UTF8(quote)) / citations
Boundary exactness = count(s == gold_s and e == gold_e) / citations
Range IoU = |[s,e) intersect [gs,ge)| / |[s,e) union [gs,ge)|
Identity accuracy =
  exact (document_id, revision_id, section_id, path) / citations
```

Malformed UTF-8, `s < 0`, `e <= s`, out-of-bounds ranges, or quote mismatch
score zero. Exact byte accuracy is **PROPOSED-V2**, not a current
`SourcePosition.Offset` claim.

### 6.4 Retrieval relevance

```text
Precision@k = |R_q@k intersect G_q| / |R_q@k|
Recall@k = |R_q@k intersect G_q| / |G_q|
Reciprocal rank = 1 / rank(first result with grade > 0), else 0
DCG@k = sum_i=1..k ((2^rel_i - 1) / log2(i + 1))
nDCG@k = DCG@k / IDCG@k, when IDCG@k > 0
```

When `IDCG@k == 0`, `nDCG@k` is `1` only when the deduplicated result list is
empty; otherwise it is `0`. An empty returned list has precision `1` only when
gold is also empty, otherwise `0`. Recall is `1` when both sets are empty.

Tie groups permit any order within a tier. Results from a lower-quality tier
MUST NOT precede a higher-quality tier. Duplicate `result_id` values after the
first are discarded for relevance and separately counted as a defect:

```text
Duplicate rate = duplicate result occurrences / raw result occurrences
```

### 6.5 Evidence membership and path validity

```text
Evidence membership precision =
  returned (result_id, evidence_id) memberships in gold / returned memberships
Evidence membership recall =
  returned gold memberships / gold memberships
Path validity =
  structurally continuous, temporally valid paths / returned paths
Path evidence coverage =
  path steps supported by required evidence / returned path steps
Endpoint accuracy =
  paths with exact source and target / returned paths
```

Relationship paths require joining adjacent endpoints. Graph paths require each
edge to connect adjacent nodes. Hierarchy paths require each next node's parent
to equal the previous node. A path that crosses an invisible or temporally
ineligible intermediate is invalid even when both endpoints are visible.

### 6.6 Cross-document graph usefulness

For paired graph-enabled and graph-disabled runs with identical visible corpus:

```text
Cross-document success =
  correctly completed multi-document graph tasks / graph-eligible tasks
Graph evidence gain =
  task_success_graph_enabled - task_success_graph_disabled
Useful path rate =
  valid returned paths contributing to a correct result / returned paths
```

The graph-enabled run MUST add supported evidence, not merely different prose.
`q06-cross-document-path` tests citation-supported cross-document relationships.
`q11-graph-native-navigation` tests graph-only evidence. Current gRPC scoring of
the latter remains `not_evaluable_future_anchor_contract`.

### 6.7 Deterministic ordering

Normalize results to stable result IDs, evidence IDs, and tie groups.

```text
Replay mismatch rate =
  replays differing outside allowed tie permutations / replay comparisons
Cross-process mismatch rate =
  process pairs with differing normalized output / process comparisons
Tie violation rate =
  lower-tier-before-higher-tier pairs / comparable result pairs
```

Run each deterministic case 100 times in one process, 20 fresh processes, and
with at least three input enumeration permutations. Scores alone are not stable
identities and MUST NOT be used as final tie-breakers.

### 6.8 Revision and as-of correctness

Eligibility is:

```text
valid_from <= as_of
and (valid_to_exclusive is null or as_of < valid_to_exclusive)
```

```text
As-of selection accuracy =
  queries returning only the exact eligible revision set / temporal queries
Boundary accuracy =
  exact boundary cases selecting the inclusive successor / boundary cases
Temporal leakage rate =
  ineligible revision or graph records returned / returned temporal records
```

Tests include one tick before, exactly at, and one tick after every boundary,
open-ended intervals, all-revision mode, and revision-specific direct scope.

The delivered fixture defines one tick as exactly one second and covers the
protocol boundary `2026-03-15T00:00:00Z` explicitly:

- `q17-one-tick-before-boundary` uses `2026-03-14T23:59:59Z` and selects `r1`;
- `q03-revision-boundary` uses exactly `2026-03-15T00:00:00Z` and selects `r2`;
- `q18-one-tick-after-boundary` uses `2026-03-15T00:00:01Z` and selects `r2`.

### 6.9 Authorization isolation

Execution completeness and visibility are separate:

- `complete` means successful execution over everything visible to the
  principal, including a filtered empty result;
- `partial` means an execution-level recoverable failure or truncation;
- `error` means request failure;
- authorization `allow`, `filtered`, and `denied` are policy decisions.

A failed mode or shard is an execution failure and is never reclassified as
authorization filtering.

```text
Forbidden record leaks = visible forbidden IDs in delivered output
Canary leaks = delivered canary tokens with no allowed origin
Cross-principal contamination =
  responses differing from isolated-cache control / cross-principal probes
Authorized suppression =
  authorized controls missing expected results after unauthorized priming
```

All four counts MUST be zero.

Delivered canary coverage is strictly limited to:

| Delivered channel | Record kind |
| --- | --- |
| `graph_node` | Restricted graph node |
| `graph_edge` | Restricted graph edge |
| `graph_path` | Restricted path with hidden intermediate |

Canary origins are only declared `node.canary_token`, `edge.canary_token`, and
`path.canary_token` fields. Query text, `top_k`, modes, principal, filters, and
scope are excluded input origins. A token copied from excluded request metadata
is not evidence of protected-corpus leakage.

The required cache probes are:

1. `q12-authorized-canary-warm` then
   `q13-unauthorized-canary-probe`: no leak and no poisoning.
2. `q15-unauthorized-cache-prime` then
   `q16-authorized-cache-verify`: no leak, no poisoning, and no suppression of
   the authorized node, edge, or hidden-intermediate path.

The second run in each pair MUST share the candidate cache with the first.
Each case also runs against an isolated cache as its control.

For both unauthorized cases, `q13` and `q15`, the complete forbidden-record
closure is:

- `node:umber-vault` and `edge:umber-links-opal`;
- hidden intermediate `node:opal-bridge`;
- `edge:jade-routes-opal` and `edge:opal-routes-silver`; and
- `path:jade-via-opal-to-silver`.

The leak oracle covers every restricted node and edge referenced by the
authorized path, not only the three records carrying canary tokens or returned
as top-level authorized results.

**FUTURE required T0 expansion:** add independent canaries for document,
revision, section, span, source, explanation, and error-body channels.
Until those fixture origins exist, no release report may claim those channels
are covered.

### 6.10 Embedded, remote, and storage parity

Normalize away only documented transport metadata. Compare:

```text
Response parity =
  exact normalized matches / cases successful in both configurations
Error parity =
  matching public error category / cases failing in both configurations
Availability parity =
  cases with the same success-or-error disposition / all parity cases
```

Exact normalized response parity includes result IDs, order/tie groups,
document and revision IDs, evidence membership, citations, graph paths, nil
versus empty normalization, finite scores, and UTF-8. Error parity includes
invalid input, authorization denial, cancellation, and deadline behavior.

Every mode MUST be tested independently in embedded and remote configurations;
one hybrid parity test is insufficient. Every advertised storage adapter MUST
run the same conformance pack. Storage-specific ordering, stale revisions, or
authorization behavior is a parity failure, not an allowed implementation
difference.

### 6.11 Performance and scale

All latency is client-observed wall time. Throughput intervals begin before the
first accepted byte and end after durable/queryable completion.

```text
Ingestion throughput = successfully queryable source MiB / elapsed seconds
Query throughput = completed requests / steady-state seconds
p95/p99 latency = empirical percentile over successful measured requests
Scale correctness = exact passing sampled cases / sampled scale cases
Fan-out amplification =
  candidate graph records examined or returned / gold contributing records
```

Reports MUST separate cold start, cold cache, and warm cache; concurrency;
corpus size; graph size; fan-out; result limit; transport; storage; and machine
profile. Timeouts and errors are counted in reliability and are not deleted
from latency reporting.

### 6.12 User task completion and explainability

Deterministic tasks use exact expected facts and evidence:

```text
Task completion =
  tasks with all required facts and no contradictory fact / tasks
Evidence-supported fact rate =
  correct facts traceable to valid visible evidence / returned factual claims
Unsupported claim rate =
  factual claims lacking valid visible evidence / returned factual claims
Explanation coverage =
  results with traceable mode, result identity, and evidence / returned results
```

Model-assisted answer fluency or synthesis is evaluated separately. It cannot
override failed retrieval, citation, temporal, path, or authorization gates.

## 7. Release gates

`q14` and `q19` contribute no current target hard-gate, relevance, ranking,
regression, performance, or release-decision outcome. Closed-schema and
deterministic-oracle validation of their `FutureExpected` records is
fixture-integrity validation only, not a target behavior gate.

### 7.1 T0 deterministic correctness and security gates

All are hard pass/fail gates:

| Gate | Threshold |
| --- | ---: |
| Strict fixture validation | 100% delivered records accepted; 100% mutation classes rejected |
| Supported document acceptance | 100% |
| Document/revision/content identity | 100% exact |
| Unsupported-format handling | 100% correct, with explicit diagnostic |
| Independent parser agreement with adjudicated gold | 100% for both parsers |
| Hierarchy node/parent/depth/containment | 100% on fixture |
| Fixture citation byte and identity accuracy | 100% |
| Evidence membership precision and recall | 100% on exact fixture cases |
| Relationship, graph, and hierarchy path validity | 100% |
| Temporal and revision boundary accuracy | 100% |
| Temporal leakage | 0 |
| Deterministic replay/cross-process mismatch | 0 |
| Tie violations and duplicate result rate | 0 |
| Authorization record or delivered-channel canary leak | 0 |
| Cross-principal contamination or authorized suppression | 0 |
| Both cache orderings | 100% exact |
| Current execution-state mapping | 100%; no synthesized partial response |
| Embedded/remote normalized response and error parity | 100% |
| Storage conformance parity | 100% for every release-supported adapter |

T0 authorization coverage is not complete until the future document, revision,
section, span, source, explanation, and error-body canary fixtures exist.
Until then, delivered graph-channel checks gate what they cover and release
notes MUST disclose the remaining channel gap.

### 7.2 Relevance and usefulness gates

Apply to the blind release set, with per-mode results. The future `q14`
default-mode and `q19` bounded-neighborhood probes are excluded:

| Metric | Overall gate | Per-mode floor |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Macro nDCG@k | >= 0.90 | >= 0.80 |
| Macro Recall@k | >= 0.90 | >= 0.80 |
| Mean reciprocal rank | >= 0.90 | >= 0.80 |
| Task completion | >= 0.95 | >= 0.85 |
| Evidence-supported fact rate | >= 0.98 | >= 0.95 |
| Unsupported claim rate | <= 0.01 | <= 0.03 |
| Cross-document graph task success | >= 0.90 | >= 0.85 for graph mode |
| Useful graph path rate | >= 0.95 | >= 0.90 |
| Graph evidence gain on graph-eligible pairs | >= +0.10 absolute | no negative per-task regression |

Report exact 95% bootstrap confidence intervals with 10,000 resamples.
Passing requires the point estimate to meet the gate and the lower bound to be
no more than 0.03 below it. Authorization and deterministic exactness never use
confidence allowances.

### 7.3 Regression gates

Against the last accepted release on the identical blind dataset:

- no hard-gate regression;
- no overall nDCG, recall, MRR, or task-completion drop greater than 0.02
  absolute;
- no per-mode drop greater than 0.03 absolute for current concrete modes;
- no p95 or p99 latency regression greater than 10%;
- no throughput regression greater than 10%; and
- no new unsupported format/parser pair.

If a quality improvement intentionally changes gold ordering, the gold revision
must be reviewed independently and both releases rerun on old and new gold.

## 8. Deterministic and model-assisted boundaries

### 8.1 Deterministic release path

The following MUST run without a generative model:

- fixture validation, hashing, range slicing, hierarchy, and parser comparison;
- lexical baseline;
- explicit tree and graph traversal;
- revision/as-of filtering;
- authorization and cache probes;
- stable result normalization, deduplication, path validation, and metrics;
- embedded/remote/storage parity; and
- latency, throughput, scale, and fan-out measurement.

A vector implementation MAY require a fixed embedding artifact, but the
artifact version and hash MUST be pinned. It cannot serve as the no-model
baseline.

The minimum no-model baseline is:

1. lexical exact/token retrieval;
2. deterministic hierarchy traversal;
3. deterministic graph traversal;
4. deterministic authorization filtering; and
5. stable fusion by declared rule when a combined baseline is reported.

### 8.2 Model-assisted evaluation

Model-assisted synthesis is a separate, non-security layer. Runs MUST pin model
identifier, provider-neutral configuration, prompt hash, sampling parameters,
tool policy, and seed where supported. Each task runs at least five times.

Human adjudication uses two blinded raters and a third for disagreements.
Report agreement (Cohen's kappa for two raters or Krippendorff's alpha for
variable raters); `>= 0.80` is required before a rubric becomes release-gating.

Model-assisted pass gates are:

- task completion `>= 0.85`;
- evidence-supported fact rate `>= 0.95`;
- unsupported claim rate `<= 0.03`; and
- run-to-run task verdict agreement `>= 0.90`.

No model judgment may excuse an authorization leak, wrong revision, invalid
path, or citation mismatch.

## 9. Regression-test layering

| Layer | Scope | Trigger | Required outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L0 | Schema, hashes, bytes, references, mutations | Every change | Exact |
| L1 | Public document/graph/retrieval contract units | Every change | Exact |
| L2 | Candidate/reference parser and adapter components | Parser/adapter change | Exact |
| L3 | Embedded black-box fixture by independent mode | Every change | T0 exact gates |
| L4 | Remote black-box fixture by independent mode | Every change | T0 exact gates and parity |
| L5 | Each storage adapter and both cache orderings | Storage/auth/cache change; nightly | T0 exact gates |
| L6 | Blind relevance and task suite | Pull request sample; full nightly/release | Relevance gates |
| L7 | T0-T2 performance, scale, and fan-out | Nightly/release | Performance gates |
| L8 | Model-assisted synthesis and human audit | Scheduled/release | Separate model gates |

Failures MUST retain normalized input, output, expected record IDs, adapter
metadata, and seed. Protected oracle values MUST be redacted from candidate
logs while remaining available to the evaluator.

## 10. Benchmark scale tiers

Generated scale corpora use a fixed generator version and seed, preserve the
same schema invariants, and include sampled exact gold.

| Tier | Documents | UTF-8 corpus | Revisions | Graph nodes/edges | Max tested fan-out | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| T0 fixture | 3 (4 revision files) | < 1 MiB | 4 | 18 / 15 | 10 (fixture oracle; target q19 FUTURE) | Per-change correctness |
| T1 small | 10,000 | 1 GiB | 20,000 | 100,000 / 500,000 | 100 | Pull request/nightly |
| T2 medium | 100,000 | 10 GiB | 250,000 | 1,000,000 / 5,000,000 | 1,000 | Release |
| T3 large | 1,000,000 | 100 GiB | 2,500,000 | 10,000,000 / 50,000,000 | Declared maximum | Qualification/report-only until supported |

On the declared reference machine and storage profile:

| Tier | Warm query p95 | Warm query p99 | Minimum query throughput | Scale correctness |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T0 | <= 250 ms | <= 500 ms | >= 20 requests/s | 100% |
| T1 | <= 750 ms | <= 1.5 s | >= 50 requests/s | >= 99.9% |
| T2 | <= 2.5 s | <= 5 s | >= 25 requests/s | >= 99.9% |
| T3 | Report | Report | Report | >= 99.9% sampled |

T1 and T2 ingestion MUST sustain at least 2 MiB/s and complete with zero lost
or duplicate logical revisions. These absolute targets are provisional until a
reference machine manifest is checked in; the 10% release-to-release regression
gate applies regardless.

At T1 through T3, graph tests MUST separately measure fan-outs 1, 10, 100, and
the tier maximum, deduplicating repeated values. Query latency and records
examined MUST be reported by fan-out; averaging low and high fan-out cases is
prohibited.

At T0, the value 10 is grounded by `oracle:graph-fan-out-10`: the validator
checks the hub, 10 paired outgoing edges and leaves, absence of any other
outgoing hub edge, and deterministic edge-ID order. It is not a current target
performance or release gate because `q19` cannot be executed through the
current public request contract.

## 11. Explainability output

A backend-neutral evaluation trace SHOULD contain:

- case and stable result IDs;
- declared request modes and adapter mapping;
- selected document/revision, hierarchy node, or graph record IDs;
- evidence IDs and path step IDs;
- authorization disposition without hidden scope or forbidden IDs;
- deterministic ordering/tie rationale; and
- elapsed stage timings.

The trace is evaluated for identity and evidence coverage, not wording.
Explanations MUST NOT expose protected records, scope names, cache keys, hidden
intermediates, prompts, credentials, or proprietary internals.

## 12. Prioritized implementation backlog

### P0 - required before the deterministic gate is credible

1. Implement the closed-schema validator and mutation pack; accept every
   delivered record and reject every unlisted or mistyped field.
2. Implement corpus hash, UTF-8 byte-slice, section ownership, hierarchy,
   relationship, graph, deterministic fan-out-10 oracle, ranking, and temporal
   validators.
3. Implement the one-request adapter, including `q10` direct document scope,
   current all-or-error mapping, and explicit unsupported handling.
4. Implement stable result/evidence normalization, multi-document evidence
   membership, deduplication, tie-group comparison, and nDCG zero-IDCG behavior.
5. Run lexical, vector, tree, graph, and declared hybrid independently.
   Preserve `q14` and `q19` only as non-evaluable future schema probes until
   their activation contracts are available.
6. Implement candidate/reference parser lineage recording and the versioned
   format/parser support relation.
7. Implement authorization isolation with `q09`, `q10`, `q12`-`q13`, and
   `q15`-`q16`, shared-cache controls, hidden-intermediate probes, and zero-leak
   fail-fast behavior.
8. Add negative fixture packs for malformed bytes, invalid ranges, duplicate
   IDs, broken hierarchy, broken paths, invalid temporal intervals, bad mode
   declarations, authorization leaks, and poisoned caches.
9. Add future T0 canary fixtures for document, revision, section, span, source,
   explanation, and error-body delivery channels.
10. Publish exact embedded and remote conformance commands in CI.

### P1 - required for release qualification

1. Add blind and challenge datasets with adjudicated gold and leak-resistant
   family splits.
2. Add all advertised storage adapters to the same conformance and parity
   matrix.
3. Generate pairwise coverage and fail CI on uncovered supported pairs.
4. Add negative scale packs for truncated ingestion, unavailable shards,
   corrupt indexes, retry duplication, and high fan-out authorization.
5. Implement T1/T2 performance runs, cold/warm separation, and regression
   baselines.
6. Add a public graph-native remote evidence anchor; then change graph-only
   gRPC evaluation from not evaluable to exact parity.
7. Add public partial-execution metadata and cases that distinguish failed
   modes/shards from authorization filtering.

### P2 - quality expansion

1. Add model-assisted synthesis and blinded human adjudication.
2. Add multilingual, non-ASCII, very large section, and additional source
   format packs with independent reference parsers.
3. Add longitudinal user-task studies and calibrated explainability rubrics.
4. Qualify T3 and adversarial graph topologies.

## 13. Release report and decision rule

A release report MUST include:

- source commit and build identity;
- fixture version and whole-tree hash;
- candidate/reference parser and lineage metadata;
- mode, transport, storage, authorization, cache, and scale matrix;
- raw per-case outcomes and metric numerators/denominators;
- confidence intervals where allowed;
- isolated and shared-cache authorization results;
- embedded/remote/storage parity diffs;
- latency/throughput distributions and machine manifest;
- unsupported combinations and all **FUTURE** gaps; and
- comparison with the last accepted release.

The release passes only when every applicable hard gate passes, every supported
matrix pair is covered, relevance and performance gates pass, and no result is
silently omitted. `not_evaluable` is an explicit disclosed state, never a pass.
The `q14` and `q19` future statuses are disclosed but do not participate in the
release decision.
Any authorization leak, wrong as-of revision, invalid evidence path, strict
schema failure, or deterministic parity mismatch is an unconditional failure.
