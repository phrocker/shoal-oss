# Offline Compaction — Operator Runbook

`shoal-offline-compact` performs a full major compaction of an **OFFLINE**
Accumulo table's tablets from a standalone process — no tserver, manager,
or compaction coordinator in the loop. It reads each tablet's input
RFiles, applies the table's resolved `table.iterator.majc.*` stack, writes
one compacted output RFile per tablet, verifies it, and hands off the
metadata delta.

This is the operator guide. For the safety model and rationale see
[`offline-compaction-design.md`](./offline-compaction-design.md).

> **Golden rule:** the table must be **OFFLINE** for the entire inspection
> run. Today, discard the dry-run artifacts and re-online the unchanged table.
> A future commit workflow must keep it offline through authoritative apply
> and verification. The tool fails closed if the table is (or becomes) ONLINE.

## 1. When to use this

- A table is offline (or can be taken offline during a maintenance window)
  and has accumulated many small RFiles per tablet you want merged.
- You want compaction work done off-cluster (on a batch host) without
  loading tservers.
- Every iterator in the table's `majc` stack has a Go port (see
  §7 — Failure modes). If any don't, the run aborts and names them; that
  gap is the iterator-forge track.

Do **not** use it on an ONLINE table — it will refuse at the fence.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

- Network access to the ZooKeeper quorum and the RFile storage backend
  (`gs`, `s3`, `azure`, `local`, or `memory`).
- The metadata-read principal + password. The password doubles as the ZK
  instance secret used for digest auth on `/config` znodes; prefer the
  `SHOAL_PASSWORD` env var over `-password`.
- The server major.minor you are reading must match `-accumulo-version`.
- **The table must already be OFFLINE.** Take it offline in the Accumulo
  shell first:

  ```
  offline -t mytable -w
  ```

  `-w` waits for the offline to complete before returning.

## 3. Flag reference

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `-zk` | *(required)* | Comma-separated ZK quorum. |
| `-instance` | `accumulo` | Accumulo instance name. |
| `-table` | *(required)* | Table **name or id** to compact. |
| `-range` | *(empty)* | Restrict to tablets intersecting `startRow:endRow` (inclusive; either side may be empty for unbounded). See §6. |
| `-dry-run` | `true` | Plan + verify only. `false` enters deprecated legacy commit seams and is prohibited in release workflows. |
| `-commit-mode` | `plan` | `plan` or deprecated `direct`; generated plans are inspection-only until the authority API exists. See §5. |
| `-verify` | `true` | Run the design §5 verification on every compacted tablet; a failure aborts the run. |
| `-out` | `.` | Directory to write the commit-plan JSON into. |
| `-storage` | `gs` | RFile backend: `gs`, `s3`, `azure`, `local`, `memory`. |
| `-user` | `root` | Principal for metadata reads. |
| `-password` | *(empty)* | Password; prefer `SHOAL_PASSWORD` env. Also the ZK instance secret. |
| `-accumulo-version` | `4.0.0-SNAPSHOT` | Server major.minor must match. |
| `-zk-timeout` | `30s` | ZK session timeout. |
| `-itercfg-ttl` | `30s` | TTL for the resolved iterator-stack cache. |
| `-log-level` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`. |
| `-version` | | Print version and exit. |

The process exits non-zero on any failure (fence refusal, unported
iterator, read/write error, verification failure, or commit error) and
logs the cause.

## 4. The standard procedure

The safe workflow is **always dry-run first, review the plan, then
commit.**

### Step 1 — take the table offline

```
# Accumulo shell
offline -t mytable -w
```

### Step 2 — dry run (plan + verify, no writes)

```bash
export SHOAL_PASSWORD=…
shoal-offline-compact \
  -zk zk1:2181,zk2:2181 \
  -instance accumulo \
  -table mytable \
  -storage gs \
  -out ./plans
# -dry-run defaults to true; nothing is committed.
```

This establishes the OFFLINE fence, compacts every tablet **in memory /
to unreferenced output files**, verifies each, and writes the commit-plan
JSON to `./plans/offline-compact-<table>-<UTC timestamp>.json`. Because no
metadata is mutated, any output files written are unreferenced orphans
that Accumulo GC reclaims — a dry run is always safe to abort.

Review the log summary (`compacted` / `no_op` tablet counts) and inspect
the commit plan (§8) before proceeding.

### Step 3 — no release commit path yet

The dry-run plan is inspection-only. Its unreferenced output RFiles may be
reclaimed by Accumulo GC, so do not retain it for future application. Do not
pass `-dry-run=false`, apply the plan with a shell/Ample writer, or use direct
mode in a release workflow.

Do not use `-commit-mode=direct`. That legacy seam bypasses
manager/coordinator/FATE authority and is deprecated by the accepted
[coordination authority contract](./coordination-authority.md).

Once the supported manager/coordinator/FATE operation exists, rerun the
compaction and apply its freshly generated plan while that operation verifies
the logical-table epoch, operation attempt, and output-file protection.

### Step 4 — bring the table back online

For today's inspection-only workflow, discard the plan and allow GC to reclaim
the unreferenced outputs, then re-online the unchanged table. Do not expect the
tablet file set to have changed.

```
# Accumulo shell
online -t mytable -w
```

For the future commit workflow, keep the table offline until a freshly
generated plan is applied by the Accumulo-authoritative operation and its
terminal result is verified; only then bring it online.

### Step 5 — validate (§9)

In today's inspection workflow, scan and confirm the original table is
unchanged. In the future commit workflow, also confirm each compacted tablet
references a single `file:` entry.

---

## 5. Commit modes (decision D-1: **Mode P only for release**)

**Mode P (`plan`, default) — conservative.** The tool emits a
machine-readable `CommitPlan` (§8) and makes **no** metadata writes. Plan
generation is release-approved for inspection only; the artifact is not
durable work because Accumulo GC may reclaim its unreferenced output.
Application remains blocked until a supported manager/coordinator/FATE
operation can protect and apply a freshly generated result. Standalone shell
or Ample appliers are not authority-preserving substitutes.

**Mode D (`direct`) — deprecated and prohibited for release.** The retained
`MetadataCommitter` seam writes `accumulo.metadata` outside
manager/coordinator/FATE authority. Shoal ships no committer, and operators
must not wire one. A replacement requires a supported Accumulo authority API
carrying the logical-table epoch and operation attempt.

The shipped CLI rejects direct mode and `--dry-run=false` before connecting to
ZooKeeper or writing outputs, so those requests produce no plan artifact.
Package-level legacy tests may still exercise `Commit` directly, but their
artifacts and errors do not describe an operator workflow.

---

## 6. Range compaction (decision D-2: **supported**)

`-range startRow:endRow` restricts the run to whole tablets that intersect
the given row range. Selection is **tablet-granular** — never sub-tablet.
A tablet is included if its extent overlaps `[startRow, endRow]`.

- `-range h:p` — tablets covering rows `h` through `p`.
- `-range h:` — from `h` to the end of the table.
- `-range :p` — from the start of the table through `p`.
- *(omitted / empty)* — the whole table.

A `-range` value without a `:` is rejected as ambiguous.

---

## 7. Verification (`-verify`, on by default)

When `-verify` is set (default), each tablet's output is checked before it
is eligible to commit (design §5):

1. **Self-consistency (primary gate).** An independent second pipeline
   re-derives the compaction stream through the same iterator stack and
   asserts every output cell is byte-identical, the cell count matches,
   and there are no trailing cells. Any divergence aborts the run and
   pins the first mismatching cell.
2. **T4 summary (informational).** A per-file summary (cell count, per-CF
   histogram, first/last key, size) computed over the actual written
   bytes.
3. **T1 Java cross-read (env-gated).** When `SHOAL_JAVA_RFILE_VALIDATE`
   is configured, the real Java RFile reader is run against the output to
   prove Java can consume shoal's bytes. Only fails the gate when it was
   actually attempted and rejected the output.

A failed verification aborts the whole run before any commit.

---

## 8. The commit-plan JSON

Written to `-out/offline-compact-<table>-<UTC timestamp>.json`. Shape:

```json
{
  "tableId": "2",
  "mode": "plan",
  "tablets": [
    {
      "endRow": "bQ==",
      "prevRow": null,
      "delete": ["eyJwYXRoIjoi…"],
      "add": { "path": "hdfs:/…/Aout.rf", "size": 4096, "numEntries": 120 }
    }
  ]
}
```

- `endRow` / `prevRow` identify the tablet extent (base64 of the raw row
  bytes; `null` = the first/last tablet).
- `delete` is the exact set of `file:` column qualifiers to remove
  (base64 of the byte-exact `StoredTabletFile` JSON, as it appears in
  metadata). Accumulo enforces byte-exact qualifier match on mutation.
- `add` is the single output file to reference (path + size + entry
  count).

**Legacy schema, inspection only:** the plan describes the input references and
proposed output reference used by existing tests. It must not be fed to a
standalone conditional-mutation applier. The future
manager/coordinator/FATE operation must validate this information together
with the logical-table epoch and operation attempt, protect output files from
GC, and apply the metadata change authoritatively.

---

## 9. Post-run validation

After onlining the table:

- Full scan (or targeted range scan) and confirm the data is intact.
  Post-compaction, versioning/age-off iterators in the `majc` stack will
  have collapsed old versions — expect the compacted view, not the raw
  pre-compaction cell count.
- Confirm each compacted tablet now references exactly one `file:` entry
  (Accumulo shell: `scan -t accumulo.metadata -c file` for the tablet
  rows, or the monitor).

## 10. Failure modes & recovery

| Symptom | Cause | Recovery |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `table … is "ONLINE", must be OFFLINE` at startup | Table not offline. | `offline -t <table> -w`, then re-run. |
| `offline fence tripped: state znode version changed …` at commit | Table went ONLINE (round-trip) during the run, or its state changed. | Nothing was committed. Re-offline and re-run from the dry run. |
| `offline fence tripped: zk session changed …` | ZK connection dropped mid-run (watches lost). | Nothing was committed. Re-run. |
| Run aborts naming an iterator class (e.g. `com.example.MyIterator`) | An iterator in the `majc` stack has no Go port. | Port it (iterator-forge track) or remove it from the table config; do not silently drop it. Nothing was written. |
| `verification failed for tablet …` | Output diverged from the independent re-derivation. | Nothing was committed. File a bug with the pinned cell mismatch; do **not** force-commit. |
| `--dry-run=false is disabled until a manager/coordinator/FATE commit API exists` | A release commit was requested before the authority API exists. | Re-run in the default dry-run inspection mode. The CLI exited before creating outputs or a plan. |
| `--commit-mode=direct is deprecated and disabled` | Deprecated direct mode was requested. | Use the default plan mode for inspection only. The CLI exited before creating outputs or a plan. |

In the deprecated legacy seams, the dangerous step is the metadata mutation
gated behind the fence and `--dry-run=false`. A crash or abort before that step
leaves only unreferenced orphan RFiles, which Accumulo GC reclaims. Release
workflows remain dry-run-only until the authority-preserving operation exists.

## 11. Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SHOAL_PASSWORD` | Password / ZK instance secret (preferred over `-password`). |
| `SHOAL_JAVA_RFILE_VALIDATE` | When set, enables the T1 Java cross-read in verification (see §7). |
