# Design: AI-aware local knowledge graph

> **Status:** proposal / design sketch. Not yet implemented. This document
> describes a direction for evolving the embedded engine; it intentionally
> does not commit any consumer to it.

## Motivation

The embedded engine (`shoal-embed`, `internal/engine`) is today a generic
Accumulo-style sorted KV store: rows of `(cf, cq, cv, ts) -> value` cells,
served over the `ShoalEmbed` gRPC service (`proto/embed.proto`) with
`CreateTable` / `Write` / `Scan` / `Flush` / `Compact` / `Status`.

Consumers that model a **graph** on top of this — nodes as rows, edges as
cells, plus derived link cells via the `graph-vidx` pattern and
`LatentEdgeDiscoveryIterator` — currently pull large row ranges to the
client and do all filtering, ranking, and traversal there. For a graph of
tens of thousands of nodes, even a single keyword lookup streams the whole
table back, because `Scan` can only bound by **row range**, not by cell
content.

The engine already contains the two primitives needed to fix this without
changing its nature:

- `internal/iterrt` — a faithful port of Accumulo's
  `SortedKeyValueIterator` stack (`Seek`/`HasTop`/`Next`/…), already used
  for versioning, deletion, visibility, and merge.
- `internal/ivfpq` — an IVF-PQ vector index.

The proposal is to expose these as **server-side query capabilities** so
that graph-shaped and vector-shaped reads execute next to the data and
return only what the caller needs. This is the same "push the iterator
down" lever Accumulo itself relies on.

## Hard requirement: additive and backward compatible

This evolution **must not** break existing deployments. Concretely:

- The current `ShoalEmbed` RPCs keep their existing semantics. New
  capabilities are exposed either as **new optional fields** on
  `ScanRequest` or as **new RPCs** — never by changing the meaning of an
  existing field.
- The on-disk RFile format stays byte-compatible. New cell conventions
  (embeddings, postings) are ordinary cells distinguished by column
  family; an engine build without the new iterators still reads and writes
  them as opaque KV.
- A consumer that ignores the new fields/RPCs continues to behave exactly
  as it does today.
- The shadow oracle (`internal/shadow`) parity gate continues to apply:
  any new compaction-time iterator that emits cells must satisfy the
  deterministic-emission-timestamp contract and pass byte-equivalence
  before it ships.

In short: existing callers keep working unchanged; the new surface is
strictly opt-in.

## Proposed capabilities

All of the following are generic KV/graph/vector primitives. The engine
defines **mechanisms**, not any consumer's domain vocabulary.

### 1. Term-index (keyword) iterator — pushdown filtering

A consumer maintains an inverted index as ordinary cells, e.g. posting
rows `idx:<term>` with one cell per matching primary row. Recall today
means: client scans `idx:<term>`, collects ids, then issues N point
lookups.

Move the join server-side: a new iterator (configured on a scan) takes a
set of term rows, walks their postings, and emits the **referenced primary
rows** directly — so one `Scan` returns the candidate nodes, not the whole
table. This is the single highest-value change; it removes the
"transfer the entire graph per query" cost measured on large graphs.

Surface: a new optional `term_filter` message on `ScanRequest` (list of
posting-row keys + the primary-row prefix to resolve against), or a
dedicated `Lookup` RPC. Either is additive.

### 2. Vector KNN scan — semantic search

Store an embedding as a cell co-located with its node row (a reserved
column family, value = packed `float32`). `internal/ivfpq` already
provides the index; expose it as a `VectorSearch` RPC (or a scan mode)
that takes a query vector + `k` and streams back the nearest node rows
with scores. Co-locating the vector with the row (rather than a sidecar
table) keeps a node and its embedding in the same tablet, so KNN results
can hydrate node attributes without a second round trip.

### 3. Embedding cells + deterministic derivation

Treat embeddings as first-class cells (reserved cf), written through the
normal `Write` path. Any embedding *derived* during compaction (e.g.
re-quantization) follows the existing deterministic-emission-timestamp
rule so the shadow oracle can prove parity.

### 4. Graph traversal & read-time scoring iterators (later)

Once (1)–(3) land, two more iterators become natural:

- **Edge-expand**: given seed rows, emit their adjacent edge/target cells
  in one scan — server-side neighborhood expansion instead of
  client-driven BFS.
- **Read-time decay/scoring**: apply a monotonic transform (e.g. a
  time-based weight) to a salience-like attribute at scan time, so callers
  can rank without writing decayed values back. This is a pure scan-path
  iterator; it never mutates stored cells.

## Layering and boundaries

- **Engine (this repo):** generic KV + tablets + iterators (term filter,
  vector KNN, edge expand, read-time scoring) + embeddings as a cell type.
  No consumer-specific schema, no domain field names baked into the wire
  format, no JVM.
- **Consumers:** define their own node/edge schema, their own column-family
  conventions, and their own ranking/consolidation policy, and compose the
  engine's iterators to execute it.

The gRPC boundary is the contract. Because consumers talk protobuf, they
remain free to be written in any language; the engine's implementation
language is invisible to them.

## Locked decisions (no re-litigation)

- **Language: Go.** The engine's mission is a JVM-free, single-static-binary,
  Accumulo-parity store. Go fits it directly (concurrency for hedged reads
  and goroutine compactors, mature gRPC/object-storage SDKs, an existing
  Accumulo-internals port validated by a byte-equivalence shadow oracle).
  The gRPC boundary already decouples the engine's language from every
  consumer, so "easier to call from language X" is not a reason to rewrite —
  it is an integration-ergonomics task (typed client, sidecar lifecycle),
  not a language change. A rewrite (e.g. Rust) would trade a large, parity-
  validated codebase for marginal tail-latency gains; embedding the engine
  in a consumer's process would couple it to that consumer and undermine the
  standalone, JVM-free mission. Keep Go.
- **Deployment shape: gRPC sidecar.** The engine runs as an out-of-process
  `shoal-embed` server (one static binary) that consumers dial. This keeps
  it language-agnostic and droppable next to existing Accumulo-style
  deployments.
- **No breaking changes.** Every capability here is additive (new optional
  fields / new RPCs / new reserved column families). Existing deployments
  are unaffected.

## Non-goals

- No domain model, schema, or business logic in the engine.
- No replacement of the existing scan/write/compact contract.
- No in-process embedding into a consumer runtime.
- No JVM dependency.

## Suggested first slice

Implement capability (1), the **term-index iterator**, end to end:
an additive `ScanRequest` field (or `Lookup` RPC), an `internal/iterrt`
iterator that resolves postings to primary rows, and a parity test. It
directly removes the measured "transfer the whole graph per query"
bottleneck and validates the pushdown architecture before the vector and
traversal work builds on it.
