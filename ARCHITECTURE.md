# Shoal architecture

## Goal
Lightweight read-only Accumulo replica. JVM-free pods that open RFiles
directly from object storage, run a minimal iterator stack, and serve
hedged single-shot `scan()` calls.

## V0 boundary

**In V0:**
- ZK + metadata-table bootstrap (Option A: from-scratch Go client, no JVM).
- RFile reader port from `core/.../file/rfile/RFile.java`, with two
  sharkbite-cribbed optimizations: async block readahead, in-block visibility
  filtering (skip cells before decompression).
- VisibilityFilter only — no other iterators.
- Thrift `TabletScanClientService.startScan` only — no `startMultiScan`,
  `continueMultiScan`, or session state. Each scan is self-contained.
- Per-replica LRU block cache. Per-replica is non-negotiable; shared cache
  defeats hedged reads.
- Java-side hedge coordinator (lives in the calling application; the
  shoal pod itself is unaware of hedging).

**Out of V0:** all other iterators (V1–V4 in the staging plan), FRESH-tier
reads, server-side BatchScanner (range fan-out happens client-side in the
SDK), HTTP frontend, full Prometheus integration, sharkbite's Python
lambda-iterator path.

## Bootstrap chain (Option A)

1. ZK → `/accumulo/instances/<name>` → instance UUID.
2. ZK → `/accumulo/<uuid>/root_tablet` → JSON `RootTabletMetadata` →
   tserver host:port hosting the root tablet.
3. Thrift `scan()` against root tablet → metadata-tablet locations + their
   files.
4. Thrift `scan()` against metadata tablets → user-table tablet→file map.
5. Cache; refresh by exception (sharkbite-style), not TTL.

## Wire protocol

Apache Thrift, IDL pinned to **0.17.0** (matches Accumulo's
`version.thrift`). The compiler version is enforced by `make thrift-check`.

Transport: `TFramedTransport`. Protocol: `TCompactProtocol` wrapped in a
custom `AccumuloProtocol` that prepends/validates a header on every
message. Header (encoded through TCompactProtocol's writers, not raw
bytes): `i32` magic `0x41434355` ("ACCU") + `byte` protocol version (1) +
`string` Accumulo version (major.minor must match server) + `string`
instance ID (must match server's). Server validates all four fields and
errors on any mismatch. See `core/.../rpc/AccumuloProtocolFactory.java`.
Sharkbite predates this header and does not implement it.

## Caching strategy

Tablet→location and tablet→file maps cached in-process. Invalidate on
Thrift errors that indicate stale state (NotServingTabletException,
transport-level failures) — same approach as sharkbite's `LocatorCache` +
`CachedTransport`. No TTL.

## Locked decisions (no re-litigation)

- Language: Go (qwal precedent).
- Wire: existing Accumulo Thrift, not new gRPC.
- Tablet→RFile source: metadata table (pulled, with exception-driven cache
  invalidation), NOT a ZK watch — corrected from the original v0 spec.
- Hedge coordinator: client SDK in Java provisioner.
- Cache: per-replica LRU.
- No FRESH tier.

# Shoal compactors

Shoal's second-half deliverable is a JVM-free compaction implementation.
Read-fleet replicas (above) handle scan-path traffic; compactors handle
the write path — merging input RFiles through an iterator stack and
emitting a single output RFile, byte-equivalent to what Java's
`FileCompactor` would have produced.

Compactors share read-fleet infrastructure (`internal/rfile`,
`internal/storage`, `internal/iterrt`) but expose different surface: a
goroutine that pulls work from the manager's compaction queue rather
than a Thrift listener that answers scans.

## Iterator runtime (`internal/iterrt`)

`SortedKeyValueIterator` is a near-1:1 Go port of Accumulo's
`org.apache.accumulo.core.iterators.SortedKeyValueIterator`. Same
contract — `Seek`/`HasTop`/`GetTopKey`/`GetTopValue`/`Next`/`Init`/
`DeepCopy` — so a Go iterator can be parity-tested against its Java
reference with no impedance mismatch. Ported iterators:

- `VersioningIterator` — newest-N per (row, cf, cq, cv).
- `DeletingIterator` — tombstone suppression; uses
  `PartialKey.ROW_COLFAM_COLQUAL_COLVIS` to skip a deleted
  coordinate's older versions.
- `VisibilityFilter` — column-visibility evaluation (also used in V0
  scan path).
- `MergingIterator` — heap-merge over N source RFiles, the bottom of
  every compaction stack.
- `LatentEdgeDiscoveryIterator` — example of a non-system, table-
  specific majc iterator that emits new cells (the "link" cells in
  the graph-vidx pattern). Carries the deterministic-emission-
  timestamp contract described below.

Stack composition mirrors Accumulo's
`IteratorConfigUtil.loadIterators`: specs are sorted ascending by
priority, then each is `Init`'d on top of the previous, so lower
priority = lower in stack = closer to source.

## Compaction stack shape

For a compactor invocation the stack is built bottom-up:

```
N source RFiles → MergingIterator → DeletingIterator → user iterators (priority asc) → output writer
```

`DeletingIterator` is auto-wrapped between the merge and the
user-configured iterators (matching Java's
`FileCompactor.compactLocalityGroup`). Without it, tombstones leak
into user iterators as live cells and divergence from Java becomes
inevitable.

## Deterministic emission contract

Any iterator that emits *new* cells during compaction (as opposed to
filtering or passing through) MUST use a deterministic timestamp
derived from its input — typically `max(source cell ts in the same
emission boundary) + 1`. Wall-clock timestamps (`time.Now()`,
`System.currentTimeMillis()`) break reproducibility: two compactions
of the same input bytes at different times would produce different
outputs, which makes parity validation impossible.

The `+1` keeps emissions strictly newer than every source cell in
the same boundary, preserving the "newest version first" invariant
the stacked `VersioningIterator` expects.

## Iterator-config resolver (`internal/shadow/itercfg`)

Reads the table's `table.iterator.<scope>.*` properties out of ZK
and materializes them into an ordered `[]IterSpec`. Layout (Accumulo
4.0):

```
/accumulo/<uuid>/config                       → site/system props blob
/accumulo/<uuid>/namespaces/<ns-id>/config    → namespace props blob
/accumulo/<uuid>/tables/<table-id>/config     → table props blob
```

Each blob is `VersionedPropGzipCodec`-encoded: `int32 version || bool
compressed || writeUTF timestamp || [gzip(int32 count, (writeUTF
key, writeUTF value)*)]`. Properties merge in inheritance order
(system → namespace → table), and ZK ACLs require digest auth with
`accumulo:<instance-secret>` for reads. Iterators referencing
classes not on the resolver's allowlist are reported as `Skipped`
rather than dropping the entire stack — operators see which iterator
a table needs ported before parity is meaningful.

# Shadow oracle

The shadow oracle is shoal's correctness gate: it runs alongside
Java compactions, runs shoal's compactor on the same inputs, and
asserts byte-equivalent output. Until the oracle is green for 24h
on a workload, the shoal compactor doesn't replace Java's.

## Tiers

- **T1**: Java's `accumulo file rfile-info` reads shoal's output.
  Tests the wire-format / RFile-writer side. Env-gated; absent
  validator = T1 not attempted, not a failure.
- **T2**: streaming SHA-256 over a canonical encoding of every cell
  (length-prefixed row || cf || cq || cv || int64-le ts || del-flag
  || value). Both shoal and Java fold cells into the hash in a
  single pass — O(1) memory per side regardless of input size.
  Equal digests prove cell-sequence equivalence by construction
  (RFile cells are sorted, so set-equal under canonical encoding ⇒
  sequence-equal).
- **T3**: vestigial. Originally a random point-lookup probe to
  catch block-index / bloom divergence the linear walk might miss.
  Subsumed by T2: if every cell at every position matches, no
  alternate read path can yield a different result. Field is
  preserved in the Report struct for wire compatibility but always
  `Attempted=false`.
- **T4**: per-file `CellsByCF` count map. Folded into the T2 pass.
  Informational — used by operators to localize divergences when
  T2 fails.

## Service shape

`cmd/shoal-compactor-shadow` runs in two modes:

- **Single-shot CLI**: explicit `(inputs, iterator-stack, optional
  java-output)` args; one Compare call; structured report to stdout
  or object storage. Used for debugging a specific divergence.
- **Service**: long-running daemon. A metadata poller watches one
  or more tables; when a tablet's `file:` set changes (a compaction
  committed), the event flows into a bounded oracle worker pool.
  Each worker fetches inputs + Java output from object storage,
  runs Compare, and uploads a JSON report under
  `<reportPrefix>/<table-id>/<unix-nanos>.json`. Prometheus-style
  metrics on `:9810/metrics` and `/metrics-json`.

## Memory shape

Shadow's per-event cost is dominated by the GCS-fetched byte
buffers (input RFiles + Java output) held in memory for re-seekable
reads. The streaming hash itself is O(1). Memory grows linearly
with the sum of input file sizes — so the service applies a
configurable cap (`maxInputBytes`, default 500 MiB) and skips
pathologically large events, surfacing them via
`shadow_inputs_oversized_total`. A future refactor that teaches
`bcfile.Reader` to ranged-read from object storage on demand would
drop the byte-buffer cost.

See [`docs/shadow-runbook.md`](docs/shadow-runbook.md) for the
operator-facing version: how to enable, what reports look like,
how to triage T1/T2 failures.
